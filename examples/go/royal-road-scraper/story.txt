                “You worry too much,” Lowe said, sipping a cup of lukewarm tea.

Pleasingly, his initial assumption had been correct. He was easily able to keep both the entrance to the park and the all important bench under observation from this position. Sure, the cafe might have seen better days—it was all faded wood, greasy tables, and a perpetually damp smell that no mana-laced cleaning rune could shift—but he’d been right when he’d argued that this would offer the perfect vantage point over the operation.

“And, if you ask me, you don’t worry enough,” Rook replied, whispering into the Sending Stone stitched into the collar of his coat.

“You should turn that frown upside down, Rooky. We’re all about to be heroes.”

Across the street from where Lowe sat, Goldleaf Park stretched out behind a meticulously maintained row of hedges, all rolling green lawn, ornamental fountains, and carefully positioned wooden benches. It absolutely bustled with early spring purpose: Mothers and children played near the east fountain, joggers looped lazily along its perimeter, and a street vendor hawked suspiciously high-quality pastries from the back of a cart. 

If you didn’t know better, you’d think it was just another sunny afternoon in downtown Soar.

But, of course, Lowe knew better. 

For example, he knew that pretty much every single one of those seemingly innocent park-goers was a member of his team. And that, in very short order indeed, some serious shit was going to go down. 

He took another sip of his tea, holding a Sending Stone lightly in the palm of one hand. It glimmered, pulsing every few seconds to confirm the secure link with the other Security Service officers. 

“Arman, status?”

A scratchy reply came through almost instantly. “Positioned near the south gate, boss. Jogger disguise holding up fine. If anyone’s watching, they’re in for a masterclass of some fucking leisurely cardio.”

Lowe glanced toward the south gate. Sure enough, Arman was there, dressed in sweat-stained shirt and shorts that probably were a whole catalogue of sex-crimes all on their own.. The big man jogged enthusiastically in place, earning a giggle from a couple of passing schoolgirls.

“Looking good, mate. But don’t overdo it, though. Nobody buys a jogger who’s too committed.”

“But boss,” Arman replied. “I’ve enchanted my nipples against chafing and everything!”

“Nobody needs to think about your nipple right now. Coda, what you seeing?”

From his position near the fountain, Coda’s voice chimed in. “I can heartily concur. I’m having to look at the fat fucker’s arse cheeks flapping in the wind and I absolutely do not need to think about his nipples as well.”

“About the layout, Coda. About the layout.”

“Ah, you should have said, boss. Plenty of sightlines. If our kidnapper’s here, they’ve certainly got options. Shadows near the hedges are prime for hiding. I’ve already flagged three spots where they could try to blend in.”

Lowe nodded, moving slightly in his chair to improve his view of that area. “Mark them and keep your focus on the bench. We don’t need any surprises today.”

Coda’s Sending Stone blinked in acknowledgment, and Lowe turned his attention to the next piece of the puzzle.

“Faulks, how’s the bait looking?”

In the heart of the park, an older man sat stiffly on a bench, his pale fingers gripping two gleaming bags of gold. He was wealthy, of course—a mining tycoon who owned half the veins beneath the Shattered Plains—but he looked anything but powerful right now. His immaculate suit was rumpled and his eyes were hollow with exhaustion.

Faulks, posing as an overly pushy vendor, loitered near the bench, selling cheap talismans to non-existent customers.

“He’s holding together,” the woman reported, though her tone suggested it was a fragile kind of ‘holding.’ “But barely. Keeps muttering to himself about how he’s going to ‘gut the bastard’—and, uh, let’s just say that’s not a vague, idle threat. It’s some real explicit, weirdo stuff. Knows his way around a filleting knife, if you catch my drift. To be honest, boss, we might want to dig a little deeper into his background. Some of these threats? They’ve got a little too much... let’s say practical detail for my liking. Guy’s not just imagining payback; he’s drafting blueprints.”

“Let him mutter, Folky” Lowe said. “Just make sure he sticks to the plan. He leaves the bags and walks away. No heroics.”

“Copy that.”

“You see, Rook”, Lowe said, leaning forward, resting his elbows on the table,“it’s all going exactly as planned. How much did we wager on this, by the way?”

“What, that this ridiculously convoluted idea of yours would actually work?”

“Yeah. From memory, we bet a Skill upgrade, didn’t we?”

“Fuck you, Lowe. We’re not all Cenorth’s Golden Boy. Some of us actually have to work for a living.”

Lowe laughed and moved his mana about within the Sending Stone, switching channels. “Control, what’s our perimeter look like?”

The clipped, professional tone of one of the dispatchers filled his ear. “Perimeter secure, sir. We’ve got two officers stationed at every gate and a rapid response team stationed just outside the park. No unusual activity reported.”

“Perfect. Keep me posted if they see anything hinky.”

“Will do, sir. Good hunting.”

He set the stone down for a moment and glanced at his notepad. 

It was mostly blank—a few cryptic sketches of various chess pieces and a list of all his people’s positions. The real plan was in his head, of course, and that was running like clockwork. A career spent working in Cuckoo House had taught him the value of improvisation, but it was also nice when a well-constructed plot actually all came together.

Especially one with such high stakes . . .

The Sending Stone buzzed again, but this time, he didn’t answer it. He waved a hand over it, cutting the feed, and activated Overwatch so seamlessly it might as well have been a reflex.

The air shimmered, as the park unfolded around him in perfect clarity. Every officer, every potential hiding spot, every possible line of approach—all of it overlaid with glowing sigils and annotations visible only to him. He could see where Faulks shifted nervously by the bench, Arman’s exaggerated jog, Coda crouching near the fountain, and Mr Highberg still clutching his bags of ransom like they were his lifeline.

The park itself lit up with magical traces. 

Shadows that were just a touch too deep, spots where the flow of mana was disrupted—potential hiding places for their suspect. He noted them all, filing the information away as he toggled through layers of analysis.

“Two shadows near the west gate,” he murmured. “Mana signature’s weak, but worth keeping an eye on.”

He tapped the Sending Stone again, his voice casual. “Coda, check the west gate. Two suspicious spots—could be nothing, could be something.”

“On it.”

As Coda moved into position, Lowe deactivated Overwatch, leaving the park looking deceptively normal again. He was hoping when he hit Level 20 he would get a threshold reward which would make that Skill’s mana demands a little more palatable. Right now - with a full slate of offensive and defensive Skills humming around him - it was too resource heavy for him to keep open.

Not for the first time, Lowe questioned the wisdom of letting his suite of Skills sprawl quite so broadly. 

Sure, a little ‘Quality of Life’ mana usage here and there was nice—hell, it had saved his skin more times than he could count—but managing it all? That was becoming a headache. Lately, it felt less like he was commanding his arsenal and more like he was juggling it, constantly trying to keep track of cooldowns, mana regen rates, and which potions he could afford to burn through. 

Just for one day, he thought, it’d be a relief to strip it all back. No swirling calculations, no intricate balancing act—just the basics. Three Skills max. Yeah, he mused, that’d be nice.

He returned his focus to the Sending Stone. “Alright, team, listen up. The ransom drop is in five minutes. Everyone stay sharp. No unnecessary movement. We want our guy to feel as comfortable as possible until he grabs those bags. At which stage, please feel free to kick a little arse.” A chorus of acknowledgments came through the Sending Stone. 

Cases with kids were the worst. And lowlives that kidnapped kids . . . yeah, Lowe was going to be lucky if there was anything left of this guy to present to his superiors at Cuckoo House.The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.

Lowe leaned back, his hand brushing the hilt of his baton—a standard-issue relic enchanted with enough punch to deal with anything short of an avatar on a rampage. He doubted he’d need it today - ideally, he wouldn’t even need to leave his seat - but it was always nice to be prepared.

Through the café’s window, he saw the tycoon take a deep breath and stand. His movements were hardly fluid, but he followed the script Lowe had written for him. With a trembling hand, he placed the two bags of gold on the bench and walked away, his shoulders hunched like a man carrying the weight of the world.

“Faulks, tail him,” Lowe ordered. “Make sure he doesn’t double back for a bit of stabby stabby action. As soon as he’s out of the park, take him back home. Coda, eyes on the bags. Everyone else, hold position.”

A silent weight pressed down on the park like an approaching storm. Lowe let it wash over him and triggered Clear Thought, a Skill that gave him a 10% increase on his Intelligence. For most people, that might not have been much, but with his stats . . . well, it was like bringing another mind online.

“Alright, team,” he said, his voice steady. “Let’s catch ourselves a kidnapper.”

***

The first sign that something was going wrong was when Highberg put the gold bags down and then, instead of walking away as planned, stubbornly planted himself on the bench. His face was a storm cloud of grief and fury. 

“I want to look the bastard who took my boy in the eye!” he bellowed, the sheer volume sending ripples through the park. Heads turned—some belonging to undercover officers, some belonging to innocent bystanders who weren’t supposed to be noticing anything unusual.  

“Faulks,” Lowe hissed into his Sending Stone as he stood up from his seat, his tea forgotten. “Get him the fuck out of there! But do it subtly!”  

The blonde officer, approached Highberg with the air of someone who had no idea she was interrupting a carefully laid trap. Her voice carried a cheery, sing-song quality that belied the urgency of the situation.  “Can I interest you in one of these fine talismans?” she said, holding up a cheap charm as if it were a rare artifact. “Guaranteed to bring you peace of mind—or maybe just a little good luck!”  

Highberg, for a moment, appeared startled by the interruption. His eyes darted to her and then back to the bags of gold sitting on the bench as if he couldn’t decide whether to argue, shout, or ignore her entirely.  

“I don’t need your damn trinkets!” he yelled back. “Get the fuck away from me.”

“Oh, I don’t know,” Fauls continued, with a breezy smile. “You look like a man with a lot on his mind. This one here—blessed by the High Priest of Nerienia himself—works wonders on restless hearts. Why don’t you step over here and have a proper look?”  

As she spoke, she gestured with her free hand, signaling for one of the other officers to close in from the opposite direction.  

“Faulk, you've got about thirty seconds before this whole thing goes tits up. Move him. Now!”  

“Working on it, boss,” she whispered back, her tone tense. 

Every second he lingered on that bench increased the risk of spooking their target—or worse, drawing unwanted attention to the ransom drop. And Lowe couldn’t shake the feeling that their kidnapper was already somewhere in the park, watching, waiting for the moment to make their move.

Then the park erupted into chaos with the horrifying suddenness of the end of the world.  

Faulks had been mid-sentence, still trying to steer Highberg away from the bench, when her head exploded in a spray of red mist and bone shards. The noise was a percussive crack that echoed off the nearby buildings, leaving a stunned silence in its wake. For one impossible moment, Highberg stood frozen, covered in the blood of the woman who had been speaking to him only a heartbeat earlier.  

Then, the screaming started.  

“Sniper!” someone yelled, but Lowe already knew better. His stomach twisted, the instinctive lurch of someone who had seen this kind of thing before. This wasn’t any mundane sniper. It was a specific Skill used by a particular felon—one designed with devastating precision and unrelenting violence in mind. 

The Black Knight.

He was running before the second shot fired.  

Another crack split the air, and Arman, the big jogger in his sweat-stained disguise, went down in a crumpled heap. His chest cavity opened up like someone had punched a hole through him with a molten fist. His enchanted jogging gear lit up briefly before extinguishing in a futile puff of mana.  

“Coda, report!” Lowe barked into his Sending Stone as his boots hit the cobblestones of the park’s central path.  

But there was no response.  

Through the smoke and chaos, Lowe spotted him—Coda, near the fountain, crouched behind the stonework like he thought it might protect him. The air around him was a golden shell, suggesting a shield Skill, but it didn’t matter. The next attack wasn’t just physical.  

A greenish light arced through the air, passed through the shield, and struck Coda dead center. His body seized, twitching violently, before collapsing into a twisted heap. The smell of burning flesh reached Lowe before the reality of what he’d seen truly registered.  

“Faulks, Coda, Arman…” Lowe whispered to himself, trying to force his brain to process the mounting tally.  

The tycoon, Highberg, was still at the bench, screaming curses into the void. “You son of a bitch! Come out here and face me!” he roared, shaking his fist at no one in particular.  

The next strike answered him.  

A golden lance of light speared Highberg from above, descending like the wrath of some unfeeling deity. His body was obliterated in an instant, the force of the attack leaving a crater where the bench had been. The bags of gold rolled harmlessly to the side, almost mocking in their mundane finality.  

“Shit,” Lowe hissed, his feet skidding to a stop as he tried to take in the carnage. His mind raced. He toggled Overwatch in desperation, hoping for some insight, some clue as to where the attacks were coming from. “Rook? Can you see anything?”

Silence.

The park was a blur of overlapping layers of magical distortion. Every potential angle, every possible vantage point lit up with mana traces. The assailant—whoever they were—was either moving too fast or using something so advanced that even Overwatch couldn’t pin them down.  

A shadow shifted in his peripheral vision. Lowe had only a moment to turn before something slammed into him.  

It was like being hit by the world itself.  

The impact drove him off his feet and sent him flying through the air cobblestones. When he came to a stop, he realised he couldn’t breathe. He looked down and saw why.  

There was a hole in his chest.  Or rather, what remained of his torso was around a hole.

A massive, ragged wound had torn through him, right where his heart and lungs should have been. Blood poured out in torrents, pooling beneath him in dark, sticky rivulets. His vision blurred.  

And then Roll with the Punches kicked in.  

The Skill’s familiar hum surged to life, flooding his body with mana and forcing the torn flesh to knit itself back together. Bones realigned. Muscles reformed. Within seconds, the catastrophic injury was gone, leaving only a faint ache where the wound had been.  

Lowe groaned, staggering to his feet. His Sending Stone buzzed weakly at his side, but he didn’t answer it. There was no point. It seemed there was no one was left to talk to.  

The screaming had stopped.  

He looked around the park, now a carmel house of shattered cobblestones and smoldering debris. Bodies lay where his team had been stationed, their lives snuffed out.

The bags of gold were gone.  

***

The rest of the day passed in a blur—a grotesque collage of questions, disbelief, and a suffocating sense of failure. 

They’d found the boy’s body in a warehouse on the edge of the district. 

Or, more accurately, they were led there.  

The laughter had been with them every step of the way, a mocking, hollow sound that echoed through the Sending Stones like a malevolent hymn. It guided them, taunting and cajoling, to a place that stank of mildew and despair. Lowe recognized it the moment he stepped inside: the kind of place where things were hidden, forgotten, discarded.  

And there, amidst a pile of broken crates and damp refuse, was the boy.  

Small. Still. His body looked impossibly fragile, as if a single breath might shatter him completely. The ropes around his tiny wrists were crude, almost insultingly so, as if whoever had tied them hadn’t considered him worth the effort of doing it properly. His wide, unseeing eyes stared up at the rotting beams above, his face frozen in the faintest shadow of terror.  

Lowe felt like he was drowning, his lungs pulling in something thick and acrid instead of air. He wanted to look away, but his eyes refused to move, as if they were paying penance for their failure by etching the sight into his memory forever.  

“Moments,” Lant said, his voice sharp enough to cut through the thick silence. The Deathcaller’s instruments hovered around the boy, faintly glowing as they read the echoes of life still clinging to the space. “He’s been dead for mere moments.”  

Moments.

Lowe’s head swam. That single word gutted him more than anything else Lant could have said. He replayed the park in his mind: Faulks’s head exploding, the sniper-like precision of the attacks, the chaos, the screaming. If we’d been faster. If we hadn’t wasted time. If Highberg hadn’t—

No. None of it mattered. What mattered was that they were too late. By moments.  

He forced himself to kneel beside the boy. His hand trembled as he reached out, hovering just above the small, pale shoulder. He didn’t touch him. Couldn’t. The thought of his own hand—the hand that had signed off on this entire operation—touching that lifeless body was too much. It felt like an insult.  

Lowe became dimly aware of his boss standing beside him, speaking. He forced himself to his feet, his movements slow and mechanical, and turned to face the man.  

“Lowe,” the boss began, his voice low and even, but carrying the weight of a thousand judgments. His face wasn’t angry. It wasn’t even furious, which would have been easier to take. No, it was worse. Disappointment radiated from him in waves, like heat off scorched metal. It settled in Lowe’s chest, heavy and sharp, more painful than any punch.  

“I don’t know what to say,” his boss continued, his words measured and deliberate, like blows from a hammer. “Your team. The boy. The gold... this is a clusterfuck. A catastrophic clusterfuck. Heads are going to have to roll for this. You know that, don’t you?”  

Lowe didn’t respond. Couldn’t. The words bounced off him, meaningless and hollow.  

The world around him felt distant, the sounds muffled, the light too dim. His team was gone. Good people. Smart people. People who’d trusted him to lead them, and he’d led them straight into their deaths.  

And the boy. 

Gods, the boy. 

That tiny, broken body would haunt him for the rest of his life. Every time he closed his eyes, he’d see it. Every time he tried to sleep, he’d feel the phantom weight of his failure pressing down on his chest.  

He thought of Faulks’s laugh, Arman’s jokes, Coda’s sharp wit. Snuffed out like candles in a storm, their voices now joining the cacophony of guilt screaming in his head.  

The worst part was that Lowe didn’t care about the consequences. He didn’t care about his boss’s disappointment, or the bureaucratic hammer that would come crashing down on him. He didn’t care about the reports, the hearings, or the inevitable stripping of his badge.  

What could they do to him that he hadn’t already done to himself?  

Lowe turned back to the boy’s body, his vision blurring with something he refused to acknowledge as tears. This was his failure. His fault. Every single step had led to this moment, and he’d been the one guiding the way.  

The laughter rang out again, faint and far away, echoing through the warehouse like a taunt from the abyss. It crawled under his skin, a sound so sharp and cutting it felt like it was carving his soul into pieces.  

And that was when Lowe knew, with cold, sinking certainty, that things weren’t over.  

They were just beginning.

            







	***





                “How long has he been sitting like that?”

“Couple of bells now. What do you think we should do?”

“Fuck knows. I’m not disturbing the Commander to tell her that, first, someone pulled the fire alarm and now the washout is sitting staring into space and crying his eyes out.”

“Don’t be a dick!”

“How am I being a dick? You know how the Commander feels about being brought in on her day off”

“Probably similar to how she feels about investigators crying in their office . . .”

The voices drifted over from outside his office, low and indistinct.

Lowe knew he’d heard these guys talking before. Knew their voices well enough that he could match them to a set of faces in the break room if he tried. But their names? 

Right now, though, who they were was gone. Slipped straight through the holes in his mind like water through a sieve. 

Since his reinstatement, he hadn’t bothered to learn the names of any of the new recruits in Cuckoo House. For one, he figured there was a good chance he wouldn’t be around long enough to make it worth the effort. And for another, he suspected most of them were wankers.

Listening to them whisper to each other just outside his door, pretending they weren’t watching him, he was comfortable that, at least with these two, he’d made the right call.

He wasn’t sure how long he’d been sitting at his desk, staring at the file in front of him without actually reading a word. Certainly long enough for his coffee to go ice-cold. And obviously more than long enough for the whispers to start.

Lowe’s hands moved on their own, reaching for the file again. It felt so much heavier than it should have. But, then again, maybe that was just his imagination. Paper didn’t carry weight like that. Guilt did. Regret did.

Then, without making any conscious decision to move, Lowe stood up, the sound of his chair scraping against the wooden floor impossibly loud. He heard the guys outside stop talking as he moved and they were gone by the time he reached his door. He looked around the bullpen, seeing heads turned just enough to track him without being too obvious about it. He let them look. It didn’t matter what any of these guys thought. 

Even back before he’d lost everything, other people’s opinions never had.

He left without a word, crossing the bullpen and pushing open the door to step out into the hallway and towards the stairs to the street.

Cuckoo House was an old building, and on this overcast afternoon, it absolutely smelled like it. Pausing in the corridor for a moment, Lowe took a deep breath and sucked in the residue of damp paper, burnt-out mana residue, and cheap coffee so strong it could - and, from the look of things, on more than one occasion, had - stripped the paint off the walls. 

Considering the lifespan of most things made of bricks and mortar in  Soar, the building had been standing longer than anyone should have had a right to expect. But its fragility showed in the way the floorboards creaked underfoot and in the way the mana lights flickered when someone with a strong enough Class walked by outside. 

The walls down this corridor were lined with old case files stuffed onto mismatched shelves, some so ancient the vellum had started to yellow and curl at the edges. The ceiling above his head was too low and the windows he passed as he walked were opaque with grime. In many ways, the whole place felt like a relic from another time. 

And the irony in that thought wasn’t lost on Lowe for a moment.

With the arrival of that file, Cuckoo House had gone from being a place where the ghosts of his bad decisions lingered just out of sight, to smacking him right in the face.

“Lowe?”

Assistant Commander Unance’s voice called after him as he started down the steps towards the front entrance. He didn’t stop. Didn’t turn around. He wasn’t in the mood for whatever he had to say. He remembered Unance from his first go around on the Cuckoo House carousel. Hadn’t liked him too much that time either.

“Lowe, you better not be walking out in the middle of your shift! We’re getting reports of a hold up at the Vault. It’s all hands on deck! Staffen wants you to meet her there.”

Lowe didn’t answer, pushing the heavy door open and stepping out onto the mean streets of Soar, then letting it swing shut behind him to cut off the increasingly angry shouting of the Assistant Commander.

The sounds and smells of Soar met him like an old friend to whom he owed money. 

The ground was, of course, wet, the cobblestones slick from rain he hadn’t noticed and the smell of damp stone and sewage mixed, challengingly, with the scent of fresh bread from the bakery opposite. It was quite the bouquet. All sorts of people moved around him in that way they always did. Hurried. Preoccupied. Their lives too full of their own concerns to notice the man in the long coat, clutching a file like it might bite him if he let go.

He was still holding the file. That surprised him. He hadn’t intended to bring it with him. Lowe slipped it inside his jacket and turned to look up at the Celestial Temple. The late afternoon light caught, for a moment, on the polished stone of its roof, throwing a dazzling gleam into his eyes. Almost as if there was a halo surrounding it. He idly wondered which of the gods up there were looking down on him right now . . .You might be reading a pirated copy. Look for the official release to support the author.

An old feeling, one he thought he’d put behind him in the last year, suddenly took hold of him. A restless, reckless instinct to spit in the eye of something so much bigger than himself. Something so powerful the whole world bent its knee and scraped the floor in its presence. Rebellion stirred in his chest - hot and self-destructive - curling up the back of his throat like a swallowed shot of bad bourbon.  

Do it, a voice whispered. 

Stand here, right in the shadow of that fucking place and give the whole lot of them the bird.  A slow, deliberate middle finger. He wondered how long it would take one of them noticed? Before some god decided to reduce him down to ash.

Do it. Then it will be all over.

Well, no. It wouldn’t, would it? Because Blood of he Phoenix  would kick in and he’d be put back into shape straight away. He could always then repeat the insult, but - somehow - it felt like that would somewhat undermine the overall, you know, impact of the gesture 

With an effort, Lowe shook off that old self-destructive impulse. It had been just a flicker of the ‘him’ that he had thought he had managed to lock away, and if he hadn’t given in to that voice during the year of his Classtration, he sure as shit wasn’t going to listen to it now he was pulling himself back together.

He was pulling himself back together, wasn’t he? The press against his side of that file suggested otherwise.

Lowe took on more look up at the Temple - did something at the very top glint back? - then turned away, feet carrying him down the street before his thoughts could follow.

He didn’t take in much of the world around him as he moved. It was like his feet stepped on their own, taking him to his destination without needing any conscious input. The sounds of Soar blurred into the background—a carriage rattling over the cobblestones, a vendor shouting about Stamina potions, the distant clatter of steel from a forge tucked away in one of the alleyways. 

None of it really registered. 

Lowe’s brain was roiling trapped somewhere between memory and nightmare, and it took him a few blocks before he even thought to wonder where his feet were taking him.

But once he did take notice, it felt more than appropriate to his mood.

And then, in seemingly no time at all, the entrance to a graveyard was before him, its gates not so much rusted by time  as aggressively themed that way. The stone archway above bore the name in ostentatious, freshly repainted gold letters—The Grand Necropolitan Rest of Our Lady of the Lingering Glance .. 

Despite its appearance of possessing great age, it was one of Soar’s newer cemeteries - by Lowe’s reckoning, it had only been open for just over a year . . .

And even in that time, it appeared to have undergone somewhat of a transformation.  The last time he’d stood here, it had been Soar Memorial Cemetery. He assumed that the Mayor, that ever enterprising twat, had sold off its sponsorship rights to one of the minor gods of the Underworld. Now, thanks to Her Opulent and Eternal Benevolence, Mictavros of the Lingering Glance - it was funny that the weaker the deity, the more ostentatious its name, Lowe thought - the place looked less like a solemn resting place for the Security Service’s fallen and more like a fairground that had lost its way and accidentally turned into a mausoleum.  

Even the most distracted of observers - and Lowe was certainly that right now - could see that someone with far too much enthusiasm and absolutely no taste had been let loose on the graveyard with a budget normally reserved for royal weddings and last-day-of-the-dictator military parades.  

Grinning skeletons—and far too many of them—lined the walkways, all cast in bone-white marble and frozen in poses that suggested they’d been halfway through an extremely cheerful jig before death had so rudely interrupted them. Draped over their shoulders, through their bony fingers, and around their ribs were banners of violently coloured silk, fluttering in the breeze with all the solemn dignity of an enthusiastic whore that had taken a wrong turn and set up shop in a morgue.

A somewhat fitting metaphor for Mictavros, Lowe thought. 

And for the first time since he’d had that file delivered, he smiled.

Every tombstone—no matter how modest it might have been originally—had been lovingly desecrated with a little enchanted lantern that flickered in a slow-burning mana glow, as if the dearly departed had requested some subtle mood lighting for their eternal rest. The lantern’s colours shifted unpredictably: snot green one moment, garish pink the next, before settling on a shade of blue that Lowe thought could best be described as aggressively whimsical. 

And, because the universe appeared to have a particular hatred for Lowe today, there was also music.  

Soft, twanging guitar notes drifted through the air, slow and sorrowful—except when they weren’t, abruptly switching into something that sounded suspiciously like an advertisement jingle, complete with a voice over and some rather jaunty tambourines. Lowe picked out the source, an enchanted skull, bolted onto the top of a mausoleum, which was letting out a tinny “The dead are never truly gone when they are cherished in memory!” before adding, in a more conspiratorial whisper, “Special blessings available at the gift shop!”  

Lowe sighed. It wasn’t that he objected to honouring the dead—far from it, that was why he was here after all. He just would have preferred not to be upsold will he did so.

Suddenly, he stumbled and looking down, he saw that the gravel path was segueing into  a mosaic of skulls made of mother-of-pearl, their eyes twinkling with embedded sapphires. He stepped slightly more heavily down on them out of spite.

"Remember, dear visitor—love’s last gift is remembrance," the Skull suddenly said and, for a moment, Lowe almost let himself appreciate it. It was a nice sentiment, really—poetic, even. A rare bit of grace in a place which was treating sentimentality like a disease.  

But then, inevitably—  

"Brought to you by the faithful of Lady Mictavros—contributions welcomed at every exit! Ask about our premium afterlife assurance plans for preferred placement in the underworld!"  

Lowe closed his eyes. Breathed in. Breathed out.  

Gods save him from the rampant, unrelenting capitalism of Soar. Or, he supposed, not. They didn’t have much percentage in doing that, did they?

Why had he come here? He hated this place. Not because of the dead. The dead had never been his problem. It was the living, the ones who had turned a graveyard into a goddamn tourist attraction, who pissed him off.  

Turning, he made his way towards the section of the graveyard that his feet had brought him, pushing his way through a gate that let out a dramatic, entirely artificial creak.

Because, of course it did.

            







	***





                “So he sent you a message, too?”

Lowe had been standing in place for about ten minutes before the other’s shadow fell over him. But he didn’t turn towards the voice right away. He tried telling himself that was because he was showing the appropriate amount of hardboiled stoicism. I’ve seen too much and lived too long for anything surprise me anymore. 

In reality, though, it was because his brain had completely short-circuited at hearing that voice. 

For a few long, stretched-out moments, he just kept staring at the graves of Faulks and Arman, his fingers curling and uncurling at his sides. The weight of the file in his pocket seemingly almost doubling in the silence.

The Mayor had given a whole song and dance routine about how the fallen heroes of Cuckoo House deserved a proper burial site here. The speech had been a masterpiece of political sincerity—meaning, at the time, it had sounded completely heartfelt but had, when Lowe had thought about it afterwards, amounted to the sum total of jack shit. 

"Today, we honour the brave souls who gave everything in service of our great city. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten, and this sacred ground will stand as a testament to their dedication. It will be a place where future generations can reflect on the courage and commitment of those who protect us and who have given everything in that service. We owe those interred here a debt that can never be repaid. However, in acknowledgement of their heroism, we can ensure their names live on, etched into the heart of Soar itself."

Lowe had thought the Mayor had even managed to squeeze out a single, dramatic tear at the end as he laid the first wreath. 

It had been all very moving. 

Extremely dignified. 

Lowe had clapped politely, nodded in all the right places, and resisted the urge to ask if, instead of planting officers in the ground, Soar might consider passing a few laws to make it slightly less attractive to murder members of the Security Services. 

But maybe that had just been him. Everyone else seemed pretty pleased with the arrangement. 

Maybe he was just built different. 

And now, in this place and at this time, a voice from the past had reached out and grabbed him by the throat. With one last look at the two pathetically small headstones—too small for what they’d given. And far too small for what had been taken—Lowe turned towards the speaker. 

He already knew who it was, of course.

Already dreaded who he was about to see.

“Afternoon Rook,” Lowe said. "Long time no see."

The man standing behind him hadn’t changed much. Which was damn impressive, considering Lowe had identified his body. 

Rook had never been a big guy, not in the way Arman had been. But he’d been solid. Compact muscle, quick on his feet, always moving like he was two steps ahead of whatever poor bastard he was about to put into the ground. All that athletic energy had meant his clothes had always been just a little rumpled, his boots polished but never pristine. The joke had always been that Rook spent too much time pounding the pavement and not enough time preening in front of the mirror for Commander Cenorth. Scruffy he might have been, but he’d definitely been the kind of officer who got things done. 

He’d never been one to rely too much on Skills. He hadn’t been obsessed with flash or appearance. 

Rook had been the poster child for possessing good instincts, respecting his training, and having a stubborn refusal for letting go of a case until it was solved. 

Apparently, that same pig-headedness had extended beyond his death . . . 

The two of them stared at each for several long moments.

Lowe wondered what the man saw. Whether he was pleased to see him. Whether he was surprised he was still in one piece. What he felt about making eye contact with the man whose complete professional failure and recklessness in planning had, according to all official records, been directly responsible for his death?

Looking more closely, Lowe could see that Rook’s face was still largely his own, but it had taken on a pallor that went some way beyond exhaustion. His skin was far too tight over his cheekbones, and deep shadows pooled beneath his eyes like bruises from the most brutal of prizefights. That brown overcoat he’d perennially wore still hung from his shoulders, but it was faded now, like it had been left out in the sun for too long, its edges fraying and its fabric thin. 

Interestingly - funny what the brain chose to flag as ‘interesting’ at moments like this, wasn’t it? - his breath was coming in slow and shallow heaves, like Rook was having to manually remember how to inflate his lungs. 

But it was his eyes—his fucking eyes—which were the biggest change. They weren’t milky or hollow like Rook was some back-alley Necromancer’s latest party trick. Nor were they burning with the tell-tale holy fire of being some god’s undead plaything. They were just… tired. So damn tired. 

Lowe thought he was somewhat of an expert in bone-weary cynicism. But he doubted he had anything on this guy. If he was putting gold on it, Rook was holding himself on this plain of existence through sheer cussed spite alone. 

"Let me guess," Lowe said, slipping his hands into his pockets, fingers brushing against the edge of the file. "This is some kind of post-mortem fuckery, isn’t it? You’re the first of three spirits I’m going to see this day who are going to teach me the profound error of my ways culminating in, I don’t know, me spending my salary on a massive fucking chicken. Awesome." 

“Getting Classtrated didn’t rob you of your absolutely A1 sense of humour, I see.”

“Just as dying left your childish good looks, wit and charm well alone.”

Rook held his hand out. After a beat, Lowe took it. The man’s flesh was ice-cold.”

There were more than a few moments of silence as they stood there, looking at each other. “Look,” Lowe finally said, “I’m just going to come right out and say it. How the fuck are you here?”

"I never liked to leave a case unfinished. Turns out Arkola agreed with that energy." 

“Arkola?”

"Yeah. Apparently, when push came to shove, my watch was very much not ended. One moment I was happily bleeding out on the grass and contemplating the afterlife and the next I was having my fucking Class reset and being told I still had ‘an important role to play’ and was being given ‘another chance’. Bye bye, Bloodhound. Hello, Threshold Guardian," Rook said, and the length of that little speech really seemed to cost him. "A year in, and I’m up to Level 49. So I have that going for me, I guess." 

Lowe swore.

Threshold Guardian? In a world bursting at the seams with bizarre Classes, that was a particularly ugly one. From what Lowe could remember, it meant Rook was clinging to the very edge of life and death, balanced on the thinnest of lines. Every heartbeat would be a negotiation. Every breath would need to be forced in and out, manually, like working a pair of ancient bellows. Unauthorized duplication: this tale has been taken without consent. Report sightings.

It would take all of Rook's mana just to keep his heart thumping and his lungs inflating. Forget for even a moment, get distracted by, say, a particularly interesting scroll, and he’d revert to being dead. And once dead, well, jumpstarting from that position was no picnic. It was, in fact, a bugger. Like trying to get a rusted engine going on a frosty morning—with no starter motor and only a half-empty bottle of something vaguely flammable. 

Not exactly the sort of Class that let you relax and smell the daisies.

It did come with some perks, though. Being largely unkillable, for one. Lots of boosts to Strength, for another. But, as people had been quick to realise, unkillable didn’t mean invulnerable. Rook could be dismembered, for example, and have his various bits scattered to the four winds. 

Which could be a bit of a logistical nightmare, really. 

There were, though, plenty of stories about Threshold Guardians managing to reconstitute themselves, given enough time. And time, when you were technically dead and being kept that way by some god’s dubious sense of humour, was something Threshold Guardians had in abundance. 

Another downside—other than the minor inconvenience of having to remember to breathe—was that people generally didn’t like hanging around invincible undead monsters. They tended to find it somewhat unsettling, for reasons no one ever really wanted to articulate to them. So, the only real employment for Threshold Guardians was guarding warehouses, crypts, and other places no one wanted to visit anyway. Perfect for the socially challenged. “Caretakers of Creepiness,” they were known.

Considering his own recent experiences with the Blood of the Phoenix, it wasn’t like Lowe was completely unfamiliar with coming back from the dead. But Rook’s Class was nothing like that - he was stuck in an endless, grinding war against the inevitable. 

On the other hand, he’d reached Level 49. That was almost a doubling of what he’d been as a Bloodhound on the day of the . . . incident. So there had to be some upside. 

Almost from the first moment in basic training, the two of them had been locked in the same pissing contest. A level here, a solved case there—one of them would inch ahead, only for the other to pull even and then overtake.

It had been a game, a good one, back when gaining XP had still been about skill, luck, and sheer bloody-minded determination. 

Thinking back, it was only because Cenorth had taken a particular interest in Lowe that he’d finally begun to pull ahead in the months before . . . well. Before. That was going to have to do for now. 

But now - thanks to the supreme fucking being overseeing Soar changing his Class to something utterly rancid, Rook had hit Level 49? 

Lowe pulled up his own stats.

Not too shabby, especially considering his Classtration. 

Of course, most of that was due to following Latham’s advice and using Essence Transmutation Theory to reset his Skills. This meant that, although he might look like a Level 26, his actual stats were twice as pure as the majority of other people. If Rook fancied making something of the circumstances around his death and push came to shove in this graveyard, Lowe was pretty confident he’d give a good account of himself.

“Threshold Guardian, mate? Pros and cons, I guess. Sure, you look like shit, but already one level below 50? You’re pretty close to playing with the big boys. Well, not playing, obviously; I imagine most people give you a wide berth. But, you know what I mean."

Rook chuckled, but there wasn’t a shred of warmth in it. "Sure, I know what you mean. To tell the truth, Lowe, I’m not loving life/death right now.”

“I’m sure.”

“You ever have a Skill you wish you could turn off?"

Lowe frowned at that, thinking about the perfect recall of that small, broken body which Grid View allowed him.

Rook obviously felt some kinship in that expression. "Yeah, I see you do. Well, that’s me, Jana. All the time. Arkola apparently wants me constantly right on the line between this world and the next. And one of those Skills doesn’t just let me stay on that line. It lets me see."

"See what?"

"Every time someone steps over the line. Every time they go from breathing to not. And I don’t just see it." He tapped two fingers against his temple. "I know."

Lowe stared at him. Rook held his gaze, and there was no humour left. Just an exhaustion which Lowe now completely understood. Rook was witnessing every death in Soar. That would be an almost constant ticking over of lives . . .

Had Arkola saved his friend, or had he singled him out for some sort of brutal, everlasting punishment?

"You remember what happened in the park?" Rook asked, voice quiet, then shook his head. "Sorry. Of course you do. You wouldn't be here if you didn’t." Rook exhaled slowly., and Lowe thought he could see gaseous mana leak out of the man’s mouth as he did so. "Well, once the fucker tore my heart out, I got to watch it. The whole thing."

Lowe’s throat tightened. When they’d pieced things together, it seemed that Rook had actually been the first of them to be slaughtered. But, if what he was saying about Arkola’s intervention was true, the poor fucker hadn’t just seen his own death. He’d got to feel every single one of the rest of their team.

Every officer blown apart in that park. Every second of agony. Every drop of blood spilled into the dirt.

All of it. Burned into his mind like a brand.

Lowe didn’t pretend to understand the mind of Arkola - such a thing would be impossible - but the dweller at the top of the Celestial Temple had never struck him as wantonly cruel. What was being done to Rook felt . . . vengeful.

What the Council had done to Lowe had been shitty. Of course, he’d be the first to shout that from the rooftops. But at least he hadn’t been singled out by a fucking god for special attention. 

“You fancy a drink, Rook? I think we’ve got some catching up to do.”

“Do you know what, Jana? I actually think I do.”

            







	***





                As it turned out, of course, Rook couldn’t drink. 

Something about his Class meant that alcohol interfered with his mana regeneration. And considering how important mana was in keeping him… well, Lowe didn’t want to say ‘alive’—but he didn’t exactly have a better term right now. 

"But that doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy watching you," Rook said, leaning back against the bar, arms folded like a man who had all the time in the world. Which, Lowe supposed, wasn’t an entirely fanciful simile. 

Lowe didn’t need much convincing. The file arriving through the window had shaken him up. Standing over the graves of his friends, even more so. And now? Now, finding out that Rook was still about, still existing by some grim technicality, bound to the threshold between life and death like a bad debt that refused to clear.

Yeah. He was amazed he wasn’t utterly paralytic yet. 

He lifted his second glass of bourbon and drained it in one go, wincing at the burn. The bartender, wisely, was already pouring the next.

"I nearly came to see you plenty of times," Rook said. “You know, after your… thing."

Lowe stared into his drink, watching the amber liquid catch the light. His thing. That was one way to put it. He turned the glass in his hand, feeling the condensation bead against his fingers. "So why didn’t you?" he asked. “I’d have liked to have known at least one person had survived that colossal fuck-up.” 

"Too angry, I guess."

Lowe glanced up at that. "At what?"

"At everything. The job. The way it all played out." He shrugged. "Me."

“Why were you angry at you?”

“For not putting my foot down more strongly that you were fucking everything up.”

Neither of them spoke for a while after that. The bar - more of a dive - really - was quiet, everyone just a little too far into their drinks to keep up the pretence of cheer. The hum of conversation drifted from the far corner, punctuated by the occasional clink of glass on wood. Behind the counter, the barkeep shuffled bottles, the sound crisp in the stillness.

It had been the only place that Lowe knew of that was seedy enough that Rook wouldn’t be barred entry but not so seedy he’d be shanked just for walking in. It was funny, he thought, how often we all sit on those lines of ‘threshold’ . . .

Rook broke the silence first. "Before we get into this, may I?" He gestured toward the now-full glass in front of Lowe, his fingers hovering just above it.

"Be my guest."

Rook bent his head over the glass and inhaled deeply, eyes slipping shut like he was savouring the scent alone. "Yeah. That’s the stuff." Then he straightened. "Sorry, where was I?"

"You were being angry at me."

"Actually, I think I said I was angry at me. I knew what you were like. I knew the way you’d been operating since Cenorth pretty much gave you free rein. If anyone was going to avoid the whole thing turning into a shitshow, it was going to be me. And I fumbled it.”

“Mate . . .”

“It was just that you kept saying it," Rook continued. There was a coiled tension beneath his words, more than a year of anger compressed into something controlled but not yet gone. "Over and over again. You had it covered."

"I thought I did, Rooky."

"Yeah. I bet you did." He looked down at the bar, rubbing his fingers together like he could scrub away the memory. "You thought your Skills meant you could handle anything. That no matter what happened, you’d be fast enough, smart enough, strong enough to keep the whole damn house from caving in on us."

"I’m not going to argue with you. That’s exactly what I thought."

"And I told you we were too exposed," Rook said, his voice rising, just a fraction. His fingers clenched into a fist before he forced them to relax. "I told you again and again. You didn’t listen."

"I listened, Rook." Lowe said quietly.

"The fuck you did! You heard me, maybe. But listening? Actually considering that maybe you weren’t some invincible Golden Boy who could solve every problem with a Skill and a cocky grin? No. You didn’t listen. And everyone died because of it."If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.

Lowe closed his eyes briefly. "You told me we needed a different plan," he said eventually.

"I begged you for one," Rook corrected. "I told you a half-dozen different ways that we were sitting ducks out there. That we were walking into a situation we didn’t understand and didn’t have anything like enough control over. That none of it smelled right. That Highberg was involved in things we didn’t fully appreciate."

Lowe didn’t argue. He didn’t have the right. Not with Rook.

"And then," Rook went on, voice suddenly quiet, "I had a hand coming out the front of my chest, Faulks' head came off like a fucking cork. Coda got cooked. And Arman went down next. And the rest—"

Lowe wasn’t sure which memory hit harder—the way the blood had looked as it sprayed across the grass, or the second between the first kill and the next when he’d known - known - that he had made a mistake, and there wasn’t a single fucking thing he could do to fix it.

"And you know the best part?" Rook said, leaning back in his chair. "The real kicker to the whole shitshow? You weren’t wrong."

Lowe frowned. "What?"

"You," Rook said, pointing at him. "Your Skills. The way you move, the way you should have been able to react. You weren’t wrong. You had it covered." His jaw clenched. "But we weren’t you, Jana. And you forgot that. You thought you could be everywhere at once. That if shit went sideways, you’d just… fix it. That if something went wrong, you’d catch it in time." He let out another one of those bitter laughs. "Turns out, you’re only one man. And one man wasn’t enough."

The silence stretched between them, not awkward, not tense. Just heavy.

"And then," Rook added after a while, "when it was all over, when Arkola had brought me back, when the Black Knight was gone and the kid was just meat in a chair—you know what the worst part was?"

Lowe forced himself to meet his eyes. "Tell me."

Rook’s fingers drummed once against the table before stilling. "I wasn’t angry at you anymore."

"That’s the worst part?"

Rook nodded. "Because by then, it wasn’t worth it. Because by the time I was enough of myself to do something about it, you’d been Classtrated and were already carrying every ounce of that guilt yourself. Nothing I was going to say would make it any heavier, would it? And that? That pissed me off even more. So, no, I haven’t felt like come around to reminisce about old times."

"I guess there’s not a lot I can say to that, is there?"

"No, Jana. There isn’t."

Lowe tipped his head back and downed the rest of his drink in one go.

"Figured you’ll need about another three of them," Rook said, gesturing to the barman. “Put it on the guy-who-got-me-killed’s tab. He’s good for it.

"Fuck you, Rook. If we’re keeping score, I saved your arse more times than I didn’t."

“True. But it’s a pretty high learning curve, isn’t it? One day you’re stopping me from submitting the wrong expenses form, and the next . . .” Rook enacted his heart exploding out of his ribcage, which made everyone in the dive go pretty quiet.

Lowe shrugged at the other patrons. “What can I say? He wants to take things further and I’m not sure I’m ready. You know what they say, once you go Threshold Guardian, you never go back. And I’m not sure rough, primitive, undead bareback sex is for me. Apparently, that breaks his heart.”

Three drinks appeared pretty quickly then. It was almost like the barkeep wanted rid of them . . .

Once everyone went back to their drinks, Rook actually laughed. A real one this time. "I missed this, Jana."

"Yeah," Lowe admitted, voice quiet. "Me too."

Then, without any more ado, the Threshold Guardian reached into his overcoat pocket and withdrew a familiar, heavy file which he dropped on the bar. Lowe stared at it, feeling something tighten in his chest.  

He didn’t reach for it immediately. He didn’t need to. He already knew what it would say, what it would contain. Instead, he dragged his gaze up to Rook’s face, scanning it for any hint, any flicker of—hell, he didn’t even know what any more.

Expectation? Resignation?

But Rook just met his eyes, expression steady in the way only the dead—or something close enough to damn it—could be.  

“I got mine yesterday morning,” he said, tapping the cover with one finger. “Figured it wouldn’t be long before you showed up if you’d been given your own copy. I’d been hanging about those graves for about twenty four bells.”  

“Sorry to keep you waiting.”  

“Oh, don’t worry,” Rook said, tone dry. “I’ve had plenty of time to get used to disappointment.”  

Lowe finally reached for Rook’s file, flipping it open just enough to see the message inside. The handwriting was the same. That same infuriating flourish at the end and that same casual arrogance laced through every word.  

I feel our previous game ended a little early.  

He ran his thumb over the words, feeling the indentations in the parchment.  

What a fucking prick.  

“Any idea why you got one?” Lowe asked, closing the file again and pushing it away like it might burn him.  

Rook shrugged. “I assume for the same reason you did.”  

“Yeah? And what’s that?”  

Rook smiled, but it wasn’t a pleasant expression. His too tight skin looked like it might split. “Because the Black Knight doesn’t just like to kill people, Lowe. He likes to ruin them.”  

Lowe said nothing.  

“He took your team,” Rook continued, voice quiet. “Took that kid. Took your career, your rep, your fucking name for a while. And me?” He tapped his own chest. “He left me standing at the door. Now he’s calling us both back to the table.”  

“I should let Staffen know.”  

“Yeah. You go ahead and do that. I’m sure she’ll put a nice report together while the Black Knight slits his next victim’s throat.”  

Lowe didn’t rise to the bait. He just drummed his fingers against the file, staring at the cover.  

Unsolved.  

He’d seen that word before, stamped on a hundred different cases. But never like this. Never in a way that felt so fucking personal.

After a long moment, he looked back at Rook. “You in?”  

Rook picked up his own glass—empty, because of course it was—and tilted it in a mock toast. “Oh, I was never out.”

 

            







	***





                “Nice of you to fucking show up, Lowe,” Staffen barked, ducking as a wave of boiling mana flew towards her head. 

Although her figure was grandmotherly, there was nothing remotely sweet about her expression as she glared at him. “Sorry if a little bank robbery got in the middle of your bloody social life!” She grabbed Lowe roughly by the collar and slammed his back against the wall as another attack whistled past his ear. The stone bit into his shoulder blades, and his shirt tore a little more. Another one for Mylaf to fix tonight. 

“Well, you know. I just assumed, since you keep telling me what a complete waste of space I am, one of your other ads or lasses would be able to handle something like a little bank job.” 

Eight or nine pairs of eyes glared back at him from behind improvised barriers of conjured stone and mana constructs. Central among them, Commander Pernille Staffen looked like she was on the verge of exploding herself. 

“Don’t quote me back to me, wanker! Have a shufty and tell me what you can see!”

Lowe poked his head out from cover and looked at the Vault across the street. It was a colossal banking house that had stood in the heart of Soar for longer than anyone alive could remember. All blackened stone, iron-barred windows and heavy, arched doorways guarded by intricate wards of protection. 

Its existence was a pretty visceral reminder that mana and money were old, old friends. 

 

Above, the building’s upper levels were demonstrated by stone balconies jutting out over the street like the jaws of some great beast waiting to swallow the world whole. At this precise moment, however, that jaw was spitting out a pretty continuous boiling wave of mana that shrieked as it tore through the air, warping space around it before smashing into the mana wall Staffen’s people had erected in the street. 

Even as Lowe looked, a wave of energy came his way, and he darted back in, the protections the Security Service had thrown up shuddering under the impact as it absorbed the hit. 

Taking a chance, he popped back out again, this time trying to see into one of the shattered windows. Inside, a figure moved—shadows distorted by the lingering aftereffects of whatever Skills had been slung about. He could properly examine that glance with Grid View later if he needed to.

“I could be wrong, but it seems like someone in the bank would like the Security Services to go away,” Lowe said.

“Stop being such a motherfucking pain in my arse!” Staffen hissed. “Whoever’s up there is throwing a shitstorm our way, and not everyone I can call on is a fucking cockroach. I need you to take point on going in there and, I don’t know, earn some of your fucking salary.” 

Adjusting his torn shirt, Lowe pulled up Grid View, eyes tracing the broken windows and the distorted shadow that danced behind them. The Vault’s interior was, oddly, pitch black. There was no line of sight and no clean entry points. 

Which was not exactly ideal. 

He looked again at a building whose exterior was very much designed to deter thieves, and was positively bristling with defensive glyphs and enchantments. This sort of old mana security measure was meant to keep people out, what on earth had happened for someone to fucking take the whole place captive. 

A heavy, wrought-iron door stood at the base, bolted tight, the original mechanism replaced with more contemporary wards. A crack ran up the stone beside it, a reminder of the last time someone had tried to brute-force their way in. He’d only been on the force for a few years when that little shitstorm went down. Was that the last time someone had tried to rob this place? He thought so.

But it hadn’t worked back then. And Lowe didn’t think that’s what had happened this time, either.

“Whoever’s in there has taken all the staff hostages,” Staffen said. “As well as a bunch of rich fuckers playing a game of ‘look at how much money I have.’ They’re not interested in negotiating. They’re just throwing all sorts of deadly shit at us whenever we try to move in.”

“Who let us know it was going down?” Lowe asked.

Staffen looked at him and then at one of the other officers. “Well? Answer the man.”

There was a pause and then an officer who looked young enough to be Lowe’s daughter spoke up. “We actually don’t know.”

“We don’t fucking know?!” Staffen’s voice was loud enough to drown out the noise of molten death pouring out of the Vault’s windows. “How the fuck are we all here then, Lund?”

The female officer - Lund, Staffen had called her - shrugged. “A message came in over the Public Sending Stone. It said: The Vault is breached. The ledger is open. Old debts stir. Morning comes, and the rider is already on the road. We sent someone to have a look and, well, someone started firing.” 

Lowe went still. He’d heard words like that before—just over a year ago, carved into the wall of a child’s empty bedroom: 

The tally is made. The coin is blood. Dawn breaks, and the road is taken.

Another wave of mana screamed out of the upper windows, sizzling through the air. The protective wall behind them shuddered again, its glowing surface spider-webbing with cracks before slowly repairing itself. 

“Do you have anyone on suppression?” Lowe asked.

“Couple of lads on the roof,” Staffen replied. “They’re stopping it so that we’re able to get this close without getting our heads blown off. The rest are spread out along the street, keeping bystanders from getting curious and, you know, getting blown to fucking pieces.” 

Lowe scanned the area, picking out a couple of reasonably familiar faces in strategic positions. He didn’t know any names, but they all looked like they were making a competent enough effort at holding a perimeter. And they were all so fucking young. The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.

Then, for a moment, his eyes blurred and it was Arman across the street, hidden behind an abandoned vendor’s cart, his massive frame barely concealed by the flimsy wood. Faulks was stationed at the alley entrance, wiry figure perfectly still, a loaded crossbow aimed at the shattered windows, eyes never leaving the shadows within. And there was Rook, shaking his head sadly at the whole thing.

Then he blinked and his vision cleared. 

“Anyone been hurt?” Lowe asked.

“Just a lot of fucking pride,” Staffen growled. “We’re looking like a bunch of morons here., stood around with our thumbs up our arses. I’m going to rip that twat’s arms off and fuck him to death with the wet end once I get my hands on him.” 

“Okay,” Lowe said. “Understood. So give me the rundown of the place.” 

Staffen’s eyes remained fixed on the building. “Two entrances—main door and a service alley around the back. Both sealed. I’ve tried to bruteforce my way in the backalley myself - I better not see you fucking smiling at that, Lowe! - but no dice.”

Lowe carefully ensured his grin stayed smothered. If Staffen didn’t have the power to blow the doors off the service alley, there was absolutely no one in Soar - short of a God - who could. 

“There’s no way in without setting off a dozen different alarms,” his boss continued, “and whoever’s inside apparently knows how to use the Vault’s defenses. They’ve somehow rigged up a mana feedback loop to that cannon, meaning its spitting out offensive Skills every time we’ve tried to crack the wards. Every single attempt at breaking the barrier had been met with a pretty brutal counterattack.” 

“And no demands at all?” 

Staffen’s jaw clenched. “None. No messages. No communication. Just floods of mana flying out the second anyone gets within twenty feet.” 

Lowe took a moment, his mind in Grid View tracing the glyphs etched into the stone walls. Some of those sigils were old. Older than him, probably older than the rest of Staffen’s entire team combined. 

A small, broken body in an abandoned warehouse.

“Okay,” Lowe said. “Here’s the play. I’m going in.” 

Staffen frowned at him. “Yes. I know. That’s the whole reason why I wanted you here, Lowe. If they’ve got a mana feedback loop up, that means they’re running low on power. Sure, it’ll still probably kill you, but you’re the only guy I have on staff who is likely to bounce back from a direct hit from that. Too fucking right you’re going in.” There was a pause. “Sorry, were you making that offer in the spirit of heroic self-sacrifice? Piss on your chips, did I?”

“I love how valued and appreciated I am as a member of this team.”

“Oh, and just to be clear at the outset, if this wanker drops you and it sticks, I’m absolutely putting it in the report that you volunteered.” 

“Wouldn’t expect anything else from you, boss.” 

Lowe summoned back his glance of the Vault via Grid View, and really examined the crack in the stone beside the door. Then he looked up, about the flickers of movement from one of the shattered windows. 

“Okay. I’m ready. Keep the others in position. If this goes sideways, send in the cavalry.” 

“And what exactly are they supposed to do if you’ve been turned into a red smear on the floor?” 

“Be really disappointed in me, I suppose, boss,” Lowe said, walking toward the Vault. 

Staffen opened her mouth to retort, but the words died as a blast of mana howled from one of the upper windows, roaring toward Lowe like a carriage made of liquid fire. 

Lowe didn’t stop walking. He did his best not to even look up. 

The bolt screamed past his head, close enough that he felt his hair lift from the wind of its passing. It smashed into the manawall behind him, nearly obliterating it and making Staffen swear a blue streak. 

Lowe just kept walking. 

Another blast hurtled toward him, this one an electric blue arc that crackled with enough voltage to fry his bones to ash. It slammed into the cobblestones at his feet, sending shards of stone spraying in all directions. His left ankle buckled as the ground shifted beneath him, a red-hot piece of cobblestone slamming into his shin. He staggered, pain flaring bright and hot up his leg, but then it was gone as Roll with the Punches activated. 

“That’s impossible,” one of the rookies from behind the manawall said. “He’s not even trying to deflect them. How is he still alive?” 

Just don’t know any different, mate, Lowe thought, feeling the ground shudder beneath his feet as another blast impacted just behind him. He felt the pressure wave push against his back like a hand shoving him forward. 

The rubble from the next explosion shot outward, turning more cobblestones into shrapnel. Several shards smashed into his side, into his shoulder, his neck—each impact registered for a heartbeat before fading away, the pain evaporating as Roll with the Punches asserted itself. 

Lowe just kept walking, eyes fixed on the iron-bound door ahead. 

A further bolt of mana seared the air, striking the ground directly in front of Lowe and disintegrating the street where he had been about to step. He paused, his foot hovering over the edge of the pit, the ground crumbling away beneath him. Lowe took a step to the left, his balance shifting effortlessly. 

“Motherfucking cockroach,” Staffen whispered under her breath. 

Lowe was only a few steps from the Vault now, and he could feel the defensive enchantments woven into the stone resisting him. These were layered wards meant to obliterate anyone stupid enough to approach when the place was in lockdown.

Well, that was the plan, anyway. 

At the last moment, another blast of mana began to pulse within the upper window. As it shot out, he stepped to the left, into the crack that ran through the stone wall. The crack was blackened, scorched with old mana burns, a gaping wound in the fabric of the Vault’s defenses. 

The mana blast faltered as it approached, then fizzled out, the charged energy dissipating into thin air. 

Lowe exhaled slowly. A dead zone. Just as he’d hoped. It was nice to be right sometimes.

He ran his fingers along the edge of the crack, feeling the absence of power, the hollow cold that only a dead zone could produce. There was no resistance, no buzz of defensive energy. This close he hoped the enchantments couldn’t touch him. They couldn’t even see him. 

A high-pitched whine signaled another spell being charged, and Lowe’s eyes flicked up to the window above. The attacker clearly hadn’t figured out why he hadn’t been obliterated yet. He watched the mana accumulate, swirling into a condensed point before releasing in a blast that hurtled toward him. 

The spell sizzled out before it even crossed the crack’s threshold, the energy unravelling and fading into the air. 

Safe now, he placed his hand on the cold metal of the Vault’s door, fingers splaying over the intricate glyphs etched into its surface. The mana beneath his palm shivered, reacting to his touch, a faint glow radiating from the runes. 

There was a pause.

Then the door shuddered, the enchantments rippling outward in concentric waves, shimmering like oil on water. The ancient wards trembled, their intricate network of protections bending—then breaking. The Vault groaned, a sound like old bones cracking, before the iron door swung open with a creak that echoed through the empty street. 

Lowe stepped over the threshold, his silhouette swallowed by the darkness beyond. 

The door slammed shut behind him, the echo of its closing ringing through the street. 

And somewhere deep inside the Vault, something started laughing. 

            







	***





                Wasting no time, Lowe moved deeper into the Vault, the strange darkness wrapping around him like damp wool. His footsteps echoed on the floor, swallowed almost immediately by the cavernous silence. Behind him, the heavy iron door sealed shut with a hollow boom, cutting him completely off from the other officers outside.  

The air around him tasted stale and tinged with something. Expelled mana? It smelt like someone had let loose an insane amount of energy in here. 

Something was epically wrong here. 

Soar Vault was not a ‘bank’ in the normal sense of the word. It was a place where fortunes were not simply stored but cultivated, and all shielded behind layers of security measures that could make even the most battle-hardened criminal think twice before testing them. Or at least, it should have done so.

The last time he’d been here - it was a perk for the Security Services that they were provided with an account here and no one had thought to close it when he was fired the first time - it had been buzzing with life. And not in the way a marketplace bustled with chaotic energy, but in the way an engine hummed with quiet power. Every surface had gleamed with polish and shine. The walls had been smooth black stone, cut exquisitely and inlaid with gold filigree, the runic wards forming an intricate lattice of security enchantments.

Well, it wasn’t much like that now.

Whenever he’d popped in to deposit his meagre loot, there had been hundreds of wealthy patrons, finely dressed, moving with the slow, deliberate confidence of those who had never once needed to consider the weight of an empty purse. Behind the counters, Clerks attended to their ledgers with an almost religious devotion that made them look more like Priests at mass than employees. And he remembered there had been at least ten Security Mages, stationed at key checkpoints.

But now?  

Now, it was dead.  

Not empty. 

Dead.  

The walls had, somehow, been drained of their lustre. The golden filigree that had traced elegant warding sigils across every surface was blackened, as though something had reached into the heart of the Vault and sucked the mana right out of the stone. The marble staircase that had dominated the centre of the room, leading up to the upper offices, was cracked down the middle, its edges flaking away like old bone. Above it, the great crystal mana-lamps that had cast everything in a warm, golden glow were completely dark.

Lowe had never seen anything like it.

The enormous wrought-iron cages that had separated the bank tellers from their patrons stood eerily open, their bars warped, bent outward as if something inside had pushed its way free. Behind them, the Clerks' desks were abandoned, papers scattered haphazardly across their surfaces, quills snapped mid-sentence, inkpots spilled and dried in thick, congealed smears.  

The vault doors, giant slabs of reinforced metal inscribed with more security glyphs than a royal treasury, were ajar.  

Not shattered. Not blasted apart in some dramatic robbery.  

Just… open.  

Like someone had walked in and turned the locks with a whisper. Oh, and they were empty. Someone had a pretty full inventory right now.

Lowe took another step, feeling the wrongness of it settle deep into his bones.  

This wasn’t just a robbery, was it? This wasn’t some desperate criminals forcing their way in for a payday.  

Something had hollowed out the Vault.  

Drained it.  

More had been stolen here than just gold.  

Where the fuck was everyone?

The Clerks. The customers. The guards.  

The hostages.  

There should have been people here. Scared. Tied up. Wounded. Dead.

Something!  

But the vast, cavernous halls of the Vault were completely and utterly empty.  

It was as if the building itself had digested its occupants. Considering his most recent investigation in Soar Museum, he had quite a lot of experience with that sort of thing. But this felt . . . different.

Lowe swallowed, trying to push back the creeping unease slithering up his spine. He checked his mana levels - all good - and spooled up Slugger. With his stats the way they were, he was pretty confident he could handle a common-or-garden bank robbery. But was this what it was? 

He wasn’t sure. This didn’t feel normal. The way this place looked wasn’t something that just happened when you were gathering up piles of cash.  

Something was very wrong.  

A muffled whimper broke the silence.  

Lowe’s head snapped toward the sound. Apparently, he was not alone.  

The whimper had come from behind one of the massive teller cages. They’d been built to keep clerks safe from the riffraff. It should’ve been a barrier, not a hiding place.

He didn’t move. Something about the place felt watched. Not in the obvious, sniper-on-a-rooftop sense - but, of course, this place had that going on too - but in that deep, primal way a man gets when walking alone in the dark and knows something is out there. His Grid View was recording everything, running through layers of heat signatures, mana traces, movement indicators—but there was nothing that obviously grabbed his notice. 

Just him and the—  

Another ragged breath.  

Lowe rounded the counter, fist glowing gold in preparation.

A man cowered there, a heap of bruises and torn fabric, his hands bound behind his back with a length of expensive silk that had once been a merchant’s cravat. A Junior Clerk, by the looks of him. Young. Pale. Probably still green enough to think his career in the Vault would lead to a quiet, respectable life counting other people’s fortunes. 

Instead, he was on the floor of a dead bank, his left eye swollen shut, dried blood crusted against his temple.  

Lowe let Slugger fade and held his hands up to show they were empty. He didn't move too close. He made no sudden moves.  

The man still flinched anyway. But then his eyes focused on Lowe and he smiled. “Oh, thank the gods… I thought… I thought you were—”  

Lowe didn’t like that smile. It didn’t look . . . normal. “Who did this to you?”  

The Clerk swallowed. His throat worked like it was trying to strangle the words before they could get out. And still he smiled. The grin growing wider. And wider.

“The… the man in black.” His lips cracked at the edge on the last word. Blood welling at the edge. “He took the others upstairs. Said he was waiting for you.”  

He gave the Clerk a once-over, scanning with Medic! for anything fatal. No broken limbs, no immediate risk of bleeding out, but the kid was rattled. Rattled bad. And that fucking smile . . . Lowe had seen men like this before—hostages who’d lived through the start of something horrific but hadn’t yet processed the worst of it.  

“Okay,” Lowe said.“Listen to me. Can you walk?”  

The Clerk nodded. Hesitated. “I—I think so.”  

“Good. Here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to get up, you’re going to head for the main doors, and you’re not going to stop until you’re clear of the building.” Lowe’s eyes flicked to the shattered windows. “And you’re going to do it fast, before I find out what the hell is waiting upstairs.”  

The Clerk didn’t move.  

Lowe’s patience thinned.  

“Kid. I need you to move!”  

The Clerk blinked rapidly, his working eye darting around the ruined Vault like he expected something to lunge out from the darkness and drag him back.  

“They—” His breath hitched again. “They didn’t scream.” The Clerk’s hands were trembling now, the silk restraints slipping down his wrists. “When he took them. The others. They—they didn’t scream. I—” He swallowed. “I think he did something to them. I don’t know what. But they just… they went quiet.”  

“Right,” Lowe said, standing. “You really need to go.”  

But the Clerk didn’t move. His gaze was locked past Lowe now, wide and unfocused.  

Lowe turned sharply, Grid View flickering back to life. He checked it. Still nothing. No movement, no heat signatures, no mana fluctuations—  Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.

But the feeling of being watched?  

Stronger than ever.  

Something was here.  

And it was waiting.

“Get out of here,” Lowe said, turning toward the stairwell. He started to leave, then paused. “Does he have a name?”  

“He... he said to tell you he was your next reminder.”  

Lowe barely had time to process the words before the Clerk’s mouth twisted, his lips stretching even wider, the smile becoming grotesque. It stretched across his face like a wound, his teeth bared in a rictus of something that most certainly wasn’t amusement. The Clerk’s jaw creaked, strained beyond what was natural, the skin at the corners of his mouth splitting open in thin, weeping cracks. 

And still the grin got wider.  

And wider.  

Lowe tried to trigger Medic! but it didn’t seem to have anything to latch onto. This wasn’t an injury in any way that his Skill recognised. Then a wet pop sounded as something inside his jaw dislocated, his cheeks tearing further, the exposed gums glistening, pink and raw.  

Lowe took a step back as the Clerk’s breath turned into a thick, gurgling wheeze. Blood trickled from his nostrils, thin lines of red sliding over his upper lip and into his too-wide grin. His fingers twitched, his spine curving inward as though his entire body was revolting against whatever was happening to him.  

Lowe had seen some bad ways to die. He’d caused a few himself. But this?  

Fucking hell. And he couldn’t even heal him.

The Clerk’s whole body jerked once—violently—like something had just pulled hard on his nerves. A fresh crack echoed from his jaw, and his already-widened smile stretched even further, the flesh at his cheeks finally giving way in a wet, meaty tear.  

And then his head exploded.  

No fanfare. No slow crescendo. Just boom.  

A spray of blood, bone, and shredded meat splattered across the floor, a thick, wet noise accompanying the sudden and catastrophic disintegration of the Clerk’s skull. The force sent fragments of his teeth skittering across the ground, chunks of grey sliding down the counter in lazy trails.  

Lowe flinched, his coat catching the worst of the arterial mess as the Clerk’s body slumped sideways, his twitching hands smearing streaks of blood over the counter’s surface before finally going still.  

The Vault went silent once again.  

Then, with an effort, Lowe stepped forward.  

Not too close.  

His boots were already speckled red, and he had no intention of making things worse.  

Lowe crouched just enough to look at the Clerk’s head—if you could even call it that. There wasn’t much left. Just an open ruin of flesh and shattered skull, the mess fanned out like someone had taken a hammer to a ripe melon.  

Then he straightened, turned, and looked toward the stairwell.  

Upstairs.  

At the top of the staircase, the corridor branched off in two directions, one on the right leading toward the main vault chamber, the other to the offices. Both were draped in darkness. Both felt wrong.  

He remembered something Latham had told him when they’d been doing those bloody awful Dungeon runs. If in doubt, always take the left. 

And all Lowe had right now was doubt. 

The hallway was lined with doorways, all of them ajar, revealing shadowed offices and storerooms littered with broken furniture and discarded papers. Lowe’s fingers twitched, instinct urging him to resummon Slugger. But he resisted. There was something about the air, something about the way it pressed against his skin, that made him think some sort of . . . Skill was waiting for him to do just that. 

His Mental Fortress wasn’t flaring, so it wasn’t anything psychic . . .

He reached the door and placed his hand on it, feeling the faint tingle of an enchantment—old, weary, but still functional. With a firm push, he opened the door and stepped inside.  

The room was a charnel house. An absolute abattoir.

Lowe stepped over a body—another one of the Vault’s Clerks, slumped forward over the body of one of the Security Mages. Both of their heads were gone, the mess fanned out in two halos across the polished wood. The stench was unbearable, thick with the iron tang of blood and the sour stink of something burned.

The others were the same.  

Tellers. Guards. Customers. The people who should have been downstairs, shuffling papers and weighing gold, were instead strewn across the floor like discarded carcasses, each of them missing the top half of their faces.

The sheer scale of it made Lowe’s stomach twist.  

This wasn’t just a slaughter. It was . . . Lowe didn’t have the words.

And at the centre of it all sat a man behind the grand mahogany desk of the bank manager’s office.  

But not the bank manager himself, Lowe thought. There was something about him he thought he recognised . . .

The man’s fingers twitched where they rested on the wood, his shoulders shaking. He looked like he was on the verge of flying apart at the seams. His hair—matted and damp with sweat—hung in greasy clumps over his forehead.

Lowe tried to get his brain firing. He needed to make sense of this. Now. The Vault had been drained. Of gold. Of people. Of something far deeper than that.  

Had this man been the one to do it? And if so why?

Lowe took a slow step forward.  

The man jerked violently, his chair scraping against the bloodstained floor. His lips moved, forming half-words, aborted syllables, but nothing made it past the tremble of his mouth.  

Lowe’s eyes flicked to the man’s hands.  

Calloused fingertips. Ink-stained.  

Far too many years of doing this told him that those weren’t a killer’s hands. Then even as he thought it, he knew that was a bullshit bit of reasoning. If he had a silver piece for every time he’d caught a killerswho’d been fucking children’s entertainers . . . well, he’d have two pieces of silver. But it was still fucking terrible it had happened twice. 

Hands didn’t tell you jack. But he was right on this. He knew he was. Wasn’t he? 

Lowe looked above the man’s head and concentrated. The words ‘Accountant. Level 16’ momentarily appeared and then faded away. This nonentity had killed an entire bank’s worth of people?  And held the Security Services at bay from the window? Nah. Not so much. 

Something was very wrong here.

“What’s your name, mate?” Lowe couldn’t have done much more to keep his voice soothing. Even to his own ears, it sounded like he was coaxing a scared dog out from under a table.

The Accountant licked his lips, eyes darting to the bodies slumped across the room as if they might save him. “W-what?”

“Your name,” Lowe said. “What would you like me to call you? Right now, you’re just a guy in a room full of corpses. That’s a bad place to be, so I thought it’d be worth us starting with something easy. Nothing wrong with telling me your name is there?”

A flicker of confusion crossed the man’s face, and for a second, Lowe thought he might shut down entirely. But then his eyes focused intently on Lowe. “Elias,” he rasped. “Elias Sten.”

Lowe nodded. “Okay, Elias. Good. Nice to meet you. You can call me Jana. Now, I need you to understand something.” He gestured at the bloodied office. “You seem to be the only person left alive in here. Which is pretty odd, isn’t it? You want to tell me what happened? I could be wrong, but I’m not seeing an Accountant as the architect of . . . well, of this.”

Elias swallowed hard, his hands gripping the arms of the chair so tightly his knuckles went bone-white. His breath was coming in fast, uneven gasps and Lowe could see his pulse hammering visibly in his throat.

“Did someone do this and leave you behind to carry the can?” Lowe gave the room a slow, measured glance. “Did someone hurt you? Are you okay?”

Elias trembled. He didn’t answer any of those questions. Not right away. He just sat there, shoulders hunched, his whole body vibrating with tension. Then, finally, in a thin, dry whisper: “No.”

Lowe narrowed his eyes. He wasn’t sure that was true. The man looked like he’d been wrung out. Every drop of colour had been completely drained from his skin. And his pupils were too wide, almost swallowing the brown of his irises. 

Shock could do that, Lowe knew. Fear could do that. But this was wrong. There was something else coiling just below the surface. Lowe took another step closer, but didn’t break eye contact. “Okay. Talk to me, Elias. Did someone put you up to this?”

The Accountant’s breath hitched, his Adam’s apple bobbing like a thing drowning. It was like he was physically forcing himself not to move.

“Don’t make me ask twice, mate. You need to work with me if I’m going to try to fix things.”

Elias made a sound—thin, high-pitched. Not quite a laugh, not quite a sob. His entire body twitched and he opened his mouth, but at first, nothing came out. Then, in a voice like spider silk stretched too thin: “The Black Knight.”

Lowe gave him a slow nod. Trying to show no reaction. No flicker of horrified recognition. Just business.

“Okay,” Lowe said. “That’s a name. So I need some details. How did he contact you? Did he meet you in person? Did he send a message? When did this start? Could you recognise him?”

Elias was breathing too fast now, eyes wild. His pulse was a visible hammering in his throat. 

Lowe took out his Sending Stone and set it to record. “Look, tell you what. Here’s the deal. You give me something useful—something I can act on—and I’ll do my best to make sure you live through this. I can’t say further than that.”

That got Elias’ attention. His gaze snapped to Lowe’s face. “Live through this?” he echoed.

“Yes. Here’s my reading of things. You don’t seem like a killer, Elias. But something terrible has happened here. Something that killed every single person except you. The best way we can both get out of this and get on with our lives is for you to tell me how.”

Elias shuddered. “It was my Skill.”

“Okay. It was your Skill. Explain how in Soar that happens,” Lowe said, keeping his voice steady.

Elias made a noise somewhere between a sob and a laugh. “I—I’m an Accountant! I have Skills for money! Not for this! But he—he made me do it!”

“Made you do what?”

Elias was shaking now. “I have a Skill—Liquidate. It drains assets, collapses accounts, pulls resources from failing institutions. I’ve used it a thousand times. But never—never on a building. On people!”

Lowe’s blood ran cold.

“He did something to me,” Elias went on, voice cracking. “Gave me something to drink. Made me sick. Told me it would work. Then he gathered everyone up here and told me to— to activate it at them. And I—I did.”

Lowe felt something sick crawl up his throat. He could see it now. A perfectly normal financial Skill, one meant for numbers, spreadsheets, and failing banks—twisted into something monstrous. He needed to know what could do that.

“Then he said I had to sit here and wait for someone to come in. He said he’d rigged it so that only one person would be stupid enough to try to come in. That this was the first payment on account for someone called Jana Lowe.” Elias’ eyes opened. “You said your name was Jana. Was this all for you?”

Lowe shook off the question. “Where is he now? Where did he go?”

Elias gave a strangled laugh. “I don’t know!”

“Elias, think very carefully before you lie to me.”

“I—I swear. I don’t know! He just—appeared. He forced everyone up here and gave me the instructions, told me to follow them. Told me I didn’t have a choice. And then—” His breath hitched. “When it was done, he left.”

Lowe stared at him. 

And then he saw it.

The twitch. The strain at the corners of Elias’ mouth. 

His lips were starting to curl.

Lowe’s pulse spiked. 

No. Not again.

“Elias. Stay with me!”

The Accountant whimpered. His lips peeled back further. 

Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

Lowe moved, fast, grabbing Elias’ shoulders and trying to link Medic! Up with him. It wouldn’t take. “Don’t listen to it. Whatever’s happening, fight it!”

Elias was trembling violently now, his whole body spasming against the chair. His mouth was opening wider. Too wide. His skin was splitting at the corners of his lips. Blood welled up in bright red streaks.

And then Elias’ skull detonated.

Lowe stumbled back, his face and coat splattered red.

The corpse twitched once.

Then, from somewhere deep in the Vault, a voice laughed.

            







	***





                Lowe’s flat wasn’t much to look at, but it was home.

Or at least, it was where he ended up when he had nowhere else to be.

The furniture had seen better decades, its various scratches and stains telling stories he hadn’t been around to witness. The lighting was dim, not out of any conscious preference, but because he hadn’t gotten around to fixing the overhead rune in the sitting room. And because Mylaf, his Drudge, did not like to overstep her boundaries. If the master wanted to stumble around his flat in the dark, she was the last person to interfere.

A half-empty bottle of something extremely strong sat on the low table beside him. But it was untouched because he knew exactly how this night would end if he let himself get too comfortable with it. So, instead, he was sipping a Banana and Strawberry smoothie through a straw. 

It gave him a 15% increase to his Intellect and Lowe figured he needed all the help he could get.  

The Highberg file lay open on his lap, pages spread out like an autopsy. He’d been reading the same paragraph for the last twenty minutes, not really seeing the words, just feeling them. Letting them settle deep in his ribs, carving out space where there wasn’t any left to give.  

But this wasn’t just about Highberg anymore, was it?

There was Rook. And then there was what had happened in the Vault.  

Lowe had seen a lot of ways to die. But nothing like that.  It wasn’t rage. It wasn’t desperation. It was brutal control.  And to leave the only man left breathing in that place as an Accountant who kept babbling about ‘the Black Knight.’  

The words squatted in his head like a slow-acting poison.  

He leaned back into the battered couch, rubbing his temple. He should sleep. Should rest. Should do anything but sit here, picking at the edges of something he couldn’t yet see. But instead, he reached for the next page in the file.  

And kept reading.  

He was so engrossed that he didn’t even look up when he heard the bedroom door creak open. Mind you, he didn’t have to. The scent of soap and something faintly floral drifted through the air, and that was enough.  

"Are you not coming to bed?" Arebella’s voice was soft, causing Lowe to look up.  

She was leaning against the doorframe, one arm crossed under her chest, the other resting lightly on the wood. She was wearing one of his shirts—it was far too big for her and the collar was slipping just slightly off one shoulder, the sleeves rolled up to keep from swallowing her hands. Her hair was still damp from the bath she’d taken earlier, a stray curl clinging to her collarbone.  

He knew the look on her face. Knew that she already had a read on the situation before she even spoke.

Lowe gestured vaguely to the mess of papers around him. "Homework," he said. "Cramming for my next inevitable disaster."  

"Right. Because you’ve always been such a diligent student."  

"Hey, I’ll have you know that I passed my last psych evaluation with flying colours."  

"And that, my dear, is a big fat lie."  

"It is," Lowe admitted, tapping a finger against his temple. "But you can’t tell for certain, can you?"  

She frowned at that. "You know I can’t."  

"I could get used to being deeply, profoundly unreadable. I’m liking being an enigma wrapped in a mystery stuffed inside a cynical bastard. Feels like we’re playing on a level playing field."  

"You know, where I’m from, we call that sort of attitude being obnoxious, not being enigmatic."  

“No reason I can’t be both," Lowe said, grinning despite himself.

Arebella moved to sit beside him, close enough that their knees brushed. “Jana, I don’t need to switch on any truth-telling Skills to know you’re struggling." She picked up a few pages from the table and grimaced at some of the images. “The Black Knight? Again?”

"Hey, I didn’t go looking for this. But it’s … found its way back to me."

“I know. Rook called me.”

“Rook?! What the fuck, Bella? Did you know he was still alive?”

“No!” Arebella glared at him. “No, I did not! My Sending Stone lit up while you were out. I didn’t know who it was and then there was Rook’s voice. He’s still pissed with you.”

“How does he have access to your Sending Stone?”

“This again? For fuck’s sake, Jana!” Arebella opened her mouth to say more, and then closed it. “No. We’re not doing this now. I know what’s going to happen if you let yourself get lost in it again. You can’t tangle with the Black Knight again."  

"It’s not like I have a choice, is it? He slaughtered a whole bank full of people tonight and left me a message."  

That gave her a moment’s pause. "Just like before?”

“Just like before.”

“Okay. But that doesn’t mean you need to throw yourself back into it like it’s some kind of penance."  

"What? You expect me to let it go?! After everything?" Lowe’s voice came out sharper than he’d meant, the words bouncing too hard off the walls of his flat.  

Arebella flinched back, but before she could respond, a creak sounded from down the hall.  

Mylaf’s head poked around the doorframe, her expression somewhere between concern and sleepy irritation. "Everything okay, sir? Miss?"  

Lowe ran a hand down his face, willing the sharp edge in his voice to smooth out. "Yes. Sorry, Mylaf. Didn’t mean to wake you. You can go back to sleep."  

The Drudge didn’t move immediately. Her gaze flicked from Lowe to Arebella, the assessment quick but thorough.  Arebella gave a slight nod, something almost imperceptible passing between them. Only then did Mylaf retreat, her door closing softly behind her.  

And then came the silence.  

It went on so long that Lowe almost wished Mylaf had stayed to chew the fat.Find this and other great novels on the author's preferred platform. Support original creators!

"Jana, what I know is that this case broke you last time," Arebella said eventually. "I was there, remember? And they were my friends too. I saw what it all did to you. Is still doing to you. I don’t think I can cope if you open all of it up again."  

Lowe turned his head, staring at the far wall like it might have answers for him. "No," he said. "Me neither. Mind you, if it all goes tits up, at least you’ll have Rook to keep you warm, eh?"  

There was a beat of silence, and then she laughed. "You’re impossible!"  

"That’s what they tell me. Mind you, I should warn you. Having met with him, I’m not sure body heat is really his thing."  

"Come to bed, Jana."  

He hesitated.  

"Not because I’m telling you to stop," she added. "Just… because you need to sleep at some point. And because I don’t want you sitting out here all night alone, staring at something that isn’t going to change just because you glare at it long enough. Things will look brighter in the morning."  

Lowe looked down at the closed file in his hands. He could still feel the weight of it, even without reading the words inside. But Arebella was warm against him, solid and real. And, for the first time in hours, he felt something other than the slow, gnawing pull of guilt from the past.  

He sighed, pushing the file onto the table. "You’re a terrible influence."  

"Actually, I think I’m the best influence you’ve got," she corrected, standing and holding out a hand. "Come on, before I start using the nice voice."  

"You fight dirty."  

"Absolutely."  

And, just this once, Lowe let himself be pulled away.

***

Lowe squinted blearily at the Dungeon console. 

Early morning starts were very much not his thing, and voluntarily showing up to one of Soar’s public Dungeon Gates before the sun had fully risen suggested he was going through some kind of psychotic break. 

But here he was. 

And he was serious about this. If the Black Knight was back, then he needed to be back to his fighting weight. The last time he’d gone up against this guy he’d had all of his Skills and his team at his back. And he’d still had his arse handed to him. 

The queue behind them was shorter than he had expected—but he guessed most of Soar’s early risers were coffee-fuelled Merchants or disgruntled Clerks rather than Level-hungry adventurers. Still, a few high-Level types were already turning up, and he figured most of those were ones who viewed Dungeon delving as a job. 

A dangerous, high-wire act of a job.  But a job nonetheless.  

The console in front of him was a circular block of ancient stone, its glyphs barely visible beneath layers of weathering. In its centre, a polished gem pulsed lazily. The various levers and dials beneath it were less mystical and more an example of whatever arcanist first designed this thing overcomplicating a fundamentally simple process.  

“Okay,” Lowe said, cracking his neck. “Remind me what I do again.”  

Latham, standing beside him in a freshly polished Temple Warder cuirass, cuffed him on the back of the head. Roll with the Punches kicked in and healed the concussion. “Little man, don’t piss about. You put your hands on the stone, you clear your mind, and you try not to make a tit of yourself. I’ve got a reputation to maintain here.”  

“I can promise you two out of three.”

Latham ignored that. “Okay. Well, let’s have a quick recap here so that you have a chance to pussy out. We’re going to be running a Level 60 Heroic, here. Hel and I do this every morning and it’s a nice way to wake us up before work. You’re here because . . . I don’t know. Arebella finally noticed you’re going soft around the middle or something.”  

“That’s not entirely fair,” Hel said, ostentatiously flexing her muscles. “It’s just as likely our mutual friend here has read the runes and realised it’s just a matter of time before a certain cute Veritas Assessor decides to trade up for someone who, I don’t know, can truly bring the thunder. To be fair, this is probably just a common-or-garden suicide by Dungeon attempt.”

“Neither of you is remotely funny, you know?”

“I don’t know,” Latham said. “I think I’m a hoot.”

“I was stood in the middle of an absolute bloodbath just a few hours ago. A little something approaching sympathy would be nice.”

“Oh boo-hoo. Did the poor Inspector have to do some Inspectoring? Seriously, mate, if the two of us are your go to for a bit of TLC, you’ve absolutely misjudged your audience.”

Lowe smiled at that. “It’s absolutely not TLC I’m looking for. That’s why I’m here. I figure a bit of recreational violence and power levelling will be just the ticket. On the other hand . . .” He placed both his hands on the stone and, immediately, the pulsing light steadied, then flared, and a translucent screen popped into view in front of him.  

Welcome, Jana Lowe.  

Please select your chosen difficulty.

A flood of greyed-out options filled his vision. Because of the ticket he’d bought - at Latham’s urging - all but one unavailable to select.  

Lvl 60 - Heroic 

Well. No backing out now.  

He tapped the option. More options appeared.  

Select Dungeon Environment:

- The Smouldering Ruins  

- The Bone Orchard  

- The Gauntlet of Chains  

Lowe frowned. “The Gauntlet of Chains? Isn’t hat’s a bit on the nose.”  

“Pick that one,” Latham said. “Straightforward. No puzzles. Just mobs, a mini-boss, and then a solid big bad. Exactly what you need if you want something to punch in the face. I usually leave him to the little lady - ow!”

Hel’s eyes glittered as she let a second bolt of lightning strike Latham. “People who wear that much metal armour probably should make sure they don’t chat quite so much shit.”  

“Look guys, I appreciate you letting me join you. Especially what with me paying for this morning and all. It’s always been your selfless altruism I’ve most respected about you. But what I need from this is for it not to turn into an embarrassing death march. Something about this case makes me think I’m going to need the levels.”  

“I can’t promise you anything, little man,” Latham said. “But I’m very much appreciating your moxy right now. Trust me, we’ve got you as you make your hesitant, baby deer steps into becoming a real man.”

“Oh, I am just drowning in sloshing man juice, right now, aren’t I?” Hel’s white-and-gold Wind Tyrant coat fluttered in the morning breeze. All of these early morning Dungeon runs - as well as her recent combat against a rampaging Dreadnaught - had helped her finally breach Level 50. She was radiating the easy confidence of someone who’d already killed something before breakfast and was looking forward to seconds.

Lowe selected The Gauntlet of Chains.  

The screen flickered.  

Dungeon Party Formed:  

- Temple Warder Latham (??)  

- Wind Tyrant Hel (50)  

- [No Class] Lowe (26)  

Entry Fee: Paid  

Initiating Delve in 3… 2… 1… 

The world of the Undercity vanished in a whirl of light and gut-wrenching disorientation. When Lowe’s vision cleared, he found himself standing in a place that made absolutely no effort to be inviting.  

The Gauntlet of Chains was exactly as advertised. A long corridor stretched ahead of him, lined with rusted manacles hanging from the walls, each linked by lengths of chain that rattled softly despite the lack of any visible wind. The floor beneath them was slick with something that might have been water, but - somehow - Lowe doubted it.  

A distant thud sounded from up ahead. Then another.  

Something was waking up.  

Lowe sighed. “So what’s the plan?”  

Latham rolled his shoulders. “We kill everything. You stay alive. Sound good? No need to overplan these things.”  

Hel cracked her knuckles, lightning dancing at her fingertips. “Oh, and if you do die? Try not to be too annoying about it. Oh, and don’t worry about Arebella in the event of your untimely demise. I’ll make sure that Arebella is appropriately comforted.”  

“Great. Fantastic. Loving this party dynamic already.”

Then the chains started moving.  

And the Dungeon run began.  

            







	***





                “All things considered, I’m going to be giving you a solid Six there, little man.”

Lowe sagged against the cracked stone wall, breath coming in ragged gulps. The completed final boss of the Gauntlet of Chains lay behind them and, for the first time in what felt like forever, he could hear himself think. The Dungeon itself wouldn’t complete until someone looted the fallen Guardian and it appeared none of them was going to be doing that until Latham took the piss a little more.

“A Six?” Lowe said, sincerely wishing there was a way to pick up XP that was less ‘stabbed in the kidneys’ intensive.

“Being generous, yes.” Latham grinned, pulling off his gauntlets with a theatrical sigh. The things looked like they’d been forged in the heart of a dying star and were probably worth more than Lowe’s entire career earnings. “Now, don’t get me wrong. For a man running a Heroic version of the Gauntlet while being—how do we put this kindly, Hel?”

“Woefully unqualified?” Hel suggested.

“Woefully unqualified,” Latham agreed. “Harsh but fair. Still, all things considered, you didn’t do half bad.” He stretched, letting out a satisfied groan at a click that sounded suspiciously like several tectonic plates colliding. “Of course, you also didn’t do half good.”

“I’d say more of a five-point-five, personally,” Hel said.

“You think? I mean, he did survive until the end.”

“Sure, but in the same way a man finishes a drinking contest by throwing up on his own boots,” Hel said. “Technically, he crossed the finish line. Less technically, he’s going to be paying for new boots.”

“Have you two thought of taking to the stage? What with being such a funny, funny double act.”

Latham reached out a hand and dragged the unwilling Inspector back to his feet. “Now, you started strong. Well, relatively speaking. Entered the Gauntlet, kept your head down, didn’t immediately piss yourself. You’d be surprised how often that isn’t the case.”

“Are we saying ‘strong’,” Hel cut in. “He tripped over his own feet when the chains first started moving. It was all a bit newborn-giraffe-trying-to-ice-skate.”

“Okay. So not strong-strong,” Latham said. “But Level 26 in a Heroic 60? I think we can make allowances. Don’t you remember being as weak as him?”

“Not really. I think I got my fourth Epic Skill around when I lost my first tooth. I can only think back so far.”

“I have literally no friends that do not suck,” Lowe said.

“Anyway,” Latham carried on. “Initial enemy engagement. First wave of Chainbound Thralls. You held your ground.”

“I got choked by a possessed chain.”

“Sure you did!” Latham agreed brightly. “Took it like a champ. And by ‘like a champ,’ I mean flailed around like a horny ferret until Hel fried the thing..”

“You’re welcome, by the way. Frankly, I’d have left you to it, but I figured you’d have whined about it later. And Arebella would probably have comments. Oh, and as I’d already taken care of business on my side, I thought I’d throw you a bone.”

“Now, the second wave.” Latham tapped his chin, a sound like granite grinding against granite. “That was when you got ambitious. Saw an opening, gamely went for it, and—what happened next, Hel?”

“Was that when he dodged left when he should’ve dodged right, got caught mid-roll, and immediately took a chain to the ribs?”

“No. That was later on. The second wave was when he ran straight into a pit trap and then tanked two Thrall attacks while trying to crawl out all on his little lonesome.” 

Lowe was pretty sure he’d coughed up a lung after that. “I got back up, didn’t I?”

“You did!” Latham beamed. “You got up, dusted yourself off, and immediately got knocked back down again.”

“The sad little noise you made when you went down the pit for the second time was pretty cute,” Hel added.

“I believe there’s a nice dent of you still embedded in that Thrall’s fist.”

“You do know that healing Skill of yours is stupidly OP, right?” Hel said. “I get you have all sorts of random shit going on under your hood, but there’s still no way you should be making it through a Heroic 60 in one piece. It’s the only reason you made it through without needing to be carried out in a bucket. Or several buckets.”

“Yeah, yeah. I’m Chachi the Wonder Cockroach. We done with Masterpiece Theatre yet?”

“Not in a million years,” Latham said. “Next up, was the miniboss. What was she called again?”

“The Shackled Warden,” Hel supplied. “For the record, I usually drop her in two hits.”

“That’s the one. And let’s take a moment to really appreciate how you handled that, little man”

Lowe shifted. “It wasn’t that bad.”

“You charged her. Screaming,” Hel said.

“Was there a different approach I should have taken? I wasn’t getting much advice in the moment.”Support the creativity of authors by visiting the original site for this novel and more.

“Well, the fact she sent you flying across the chamber should have given you a hint. Never seen someone somersault quite that many times without meaning to. Now, I’ll admit, you rallied after that. By which I mean, you stayed behind me and Hel and let us do most of the work. Tactical. Smart. You let us do all the heavy lifting, conserved your stamina, and, most importantly, didn’t die. Which brings us, finally, to the Gauntlet’s final test.”

“Right,” Lowe said, looking at the body behind them. “The Chainlord.”

“You know, for all the joshing,” Latham said. “I’ll actually give you props there. That fight should’ve put you down. Permanently. But you kept getting up, you kept swinging, and eventually—eventually—we killed the bastard. With minimal intervention on our part, even.”

Hel tilted her head. “Well. Some intervention.”

“You threw a lightning bolt the size of a carriage,” Lowe said.

“Yes, but you were distracting it,” Latham grinned. “Like a legend.”

“Right.”

“And that, my friend, is why I’m giving you a six.”

“I still think you’re being generous,” Hel said.

“You survived, you contributed, and you learned. I think.  And, what is more, you get to loot a Level 60 Heroic Dungeon Boss and speak to the nice Merchant over there.”

Lowe looked over at the NPC Merchant that had materialised near the dissolving corpse of the Chainlord. The figure was nothing like the Merchant he remembered from his last Dungeon run. This one was hunched beneath layers of tattered cloth, the hood drawn low enough to cast its face in deep shadow. Rings adorned every visible finger—twisted bands of tarnished silver and iron, some set with cracked gemstones, others carved with sigils.

Then the air around the merchant shimmered, reality bending at the edges, and a voice came out—not the dry, scripted tone of an NPC, but something rich with amusement, like a storyteller who already knew how the tale would end. Lowe recognised it instantly.

Well, look at you. Still standing. Mostly. Alright, kid, let’s call this a bonus round. The house rules say you shouldn’t have access to anything like yet. If ever. But, eh… who’s gonna stop me? Take it, try not to die too quickly, and maybe—just maybe—you’ll start seeing the bigger picture. And if you get really struck, pop up and see me sometime. From memory, you know the way.

Oh great, Lowe thought, just what I need in my life on top of everything else right now.

The defeated Dungeon boss lay in a heap, its armour rusted and broken, the massive chains that had once coiled around its whole body now slack and unmoving. He remembered hitting it once with Slugger which meant he was able to loot, and his mind was suddenly filling up with a list of rewards. 

Of course, most of it was completely useless to him. Level 60 weapons and armour, far out of his ability to equip. There was some heavy plate, an executioner’s axe nearly the size of his whole body and a pair of boots still dripping with blood. He didn’t think Latham or Hel would be very interested in any of it, but he was sure they could offload it to the Merchant for a decent sum. It might even cover the cost of the entry fee.

Then something caught his eye at the bottom of the list.

It was a relic, bound in chains of some sort of spectral metal, and the name of it kept shifting and flickering as though uncertain whether it should be seen at all.  

The Shackled Grasp.

That was it. That was all the description said.

Lowe frowned, reaching out for it and the moment his fingers brushed the surface, the chains unraveled, dissolving into curling wisps of darkness that then slipped around his wrist like living ink. The item settled tightly at the end of his arm, surprisingly light, the surface warm against his skin. It looked like the remnants of a broken manacle, its shattered links trailing off into nothing.  

Hel put a hand on his shoulder, leaning in to look at it.“Fuck a duck! That’s… very much not supposed to be here.”  

“Yeah. Whatever the fuck that is is not in any version of this loot table I’ve seen,” Latham said.  

Lowe looked between them. “You’re sure?”  

“Absolutely,” Hel said. “We’ve run this Gauntlet countless times. I’ve never seen that thing show up.”  

“Which means,” Latham said, “someone wants you to have it.” The work that the Temple Warder’s eyebrows did there was not especially subtle. If he could have signed ‘Arkola’ with the movement alone, he would have done.

Lowe rolled the manacle over and over on his wrist, watching the way the broken links seemed to suck in all the light. “There’s no description,” he said.

“Well, no,” said Latham. “It looks like a Unique Soulbound item. You’re going to need to bind it before you can examine it.”

“Well, that sounds like bollocks,” Lowe said. “I have to bind the thing before I know what it does? What happens if it, I don’t know, one-shots me?”

“Don’t be wet, Lowe. It’s a Dungeon reward, not a fucking trap. Unique items don’t fall from trees. If you don’t want it, hand it over to someone with the balls to wear it.” Hel held out her hand.

The Merchant cleared its throat and then shook its head. 

“Seems like this is meant for you and you alone, little man. Come on, bind it and put us all out of misery. Remember, there’s a reason you came in with us this morning. If you’re looking for power, I think - by hook or by crook - you’ve found a big wodge of it right there.”

Lowe looked at both of them for a moment and then closed his eyes to concentrate on his tentative connection to the manacle. Cuckoo House had all sorts of relics in their storeroom and, once upon a time, he’d been able to check them out whenever a case demanded. He assumed ‘binding’ with this item would be similar to whenever he linked with one of those.

The Shackled Grasp 

A relic of broken pacts and forgotten chains. No known record exists of this item. Its existence is an anomaly. Its purpose? Unclear. But it fits you well.  

Effects: 



 The Board is Set (Passive) "Every move is answered. Every weight, balanced." Damage received does not disappear. Instead, it becomes Pressure which is stored in invisible chains that tighten with each attack - mental or physical. Bearer can unleash this Pressure in three ways:  



     Retaliation: Converts accumulated Pressure into a single devastating counterstrike or a chain of lesser attacks.  

     Endurance: Spends Pressure to restore Stamina and Mana, granting unnatural longevity in a drawn-out fight.  

     Dispersal: Releases stored Pressure as an area shockwave, knocking back enemies and breaking minor bindings.  

   Warning: If Pressure is not spent before combat ends, it drags bearer down instead, applying debilitating fatigue until he rests.  



 Chains of the Unseen (Active – No Cost, No Cooldown)  "A shackle is only as strong as the will that forged it." Allows bearer to suppress an opponents Skill for one minute per combat encounter.  

 The Gambit’s Bindings (Passive) "Every chain has a master. Every master, a chain." Bearer’s resistance to control effects—both physical and mental—is heightened to an unnatural degree. Attempts to bind, ensnare, silence, or force obedience falter in his presence. 



“Well,” Latham whistled, “I think breakfast is going to be on you . . .”

 

            







	***





                Lowe looked out of the cafe’s window, watching the way the Celestial Temple caught the morning light. From this angle, it looked almost benign as it stood gleaming against the sky. It might have been his imagination, but somewhere up there—just at the edge of sight—he thought something twinkled at.  

If you get really stuck, pop up and see me,, the Merchant had said. Or whoever had been wearing the NPC’s skin.  

Lowe didn't need to bring all his considerable powers of deduction to bear to figure out Arkola was meddling in his life again. Because that always worked out great for him, didn’t it?  

At least Hel still had her traditions. ‘Crazy Xim’s Cafe’ was a relic of a simpler time. It was a place that had seen generations of adventurers pass through, some to rise, some to fall, and some to disappear altogether. It also happened to be where she and the rest of her fugitive Out of Bounds squad had plotted the death of Gianna d’Avec. 

Latham was already working through his third plate of bacon sandwiches, a mound of greasy bread and meat that he was dismantling with almost religious reverence. Hel was nursing a cup of coffee so black it looked like it could swallow midnight whole.

“We heard about what happened in the Vault,” Latham said between mouthfuls. “You okay?”  

Now that they were free of the Dungeon, both of his friends seemed a little more like themselves. Looser. Less ‘on show,’ as it were. Hel was slouched in her chair, while Latham, when stuffing his face, didn’t look quite as epically intimidating. Although, considering the speed in which the Agency Server delivered a new plate of sandwiches, it did suggest all such things were very much relative . . .

Lowe shrugged the big man’s question away, pushing his own fried food around the plate with a fork. He hadn’t really had much of an appetite for anything that wasn’t Mylaf’s cooking lately. “I’m fine. It was what it was.”  

“From what I heard, Lowe, it was more than that.” Hel’s gaze was suddenly sharp over the rim of her cup. “Bodies everywhere. And you were called out. Mentioned by name just before the guy who murdered the hostages went boom himself. Your work or …”  

Despite being a supposedly retired Out of Bounds agent, Hel had an infuriating knack for keeping herself suspiciously well informed. “Wasn’t me,” he said. “And I don’t think it was self-inflicted either. Someone was pulling a whole lot of strings back there.”

“A someone who mentioned you by name?” she said.

“Yeah.”

Hel raised an eyebrow. “A someone who you might have the teeniest bit of history with?

“Maybe.”

“And you’re going to pretend it doesn’t bother you?”  

“I’ll summon the mental reserves to get over it.”

Latham wiped his mouth, washing down his latest bite with a long swig from a chipped ceramic mug. “So how are you going to play this? I presume you’ve got more going on in that head of yours than just seeking to power up? Though I don’t think that’s a bad move. Even with, you know, all your blatant cheating, a Level 60 Heroic boss kicked your arse.” 

“Thanks for the pep talk. But I’ve got nothing much yet. I met up with a guy from my old team. He’s got his own version of an ‘I’m back!’ message too.”

“The Black Knight,” Latham rumbled. “He was a nasty fucker. Even we were put on watch for him at the height of it. Though he never came for an Avatar, more’s the pity. The way I heard it, you nearly caught him . . .”

And then Lowe was back in a different cafe, the warm glow of Crazy Xim’s being replaced by a very different vibe. Although similar faded wood. Equally greasy tables. He’d been sitting in the far corner, hadn’t he? Back to the wall, where he could see both the entrance to Goldleaf Park and that all-important bench. It had been perfect for the job. And then Rook was whispering bad vibes into his Sending Stone.  

You should turn that frown upside down, Rooky. We’re all about to be heroes.

In a blink, the memory faded, leaving only the clatter of plates and the worried faces of his friends in front of him.

“Sorry?” Lowe said. “I didn’t hear what you said.”

“I’m not surprised. You were fucking miles away!” Hel said. “If it wasn’t for your insane Mental Fortress Skill I’d have thought someone might have possessed you.”

“You okay, little man?”

Lowe shook his head, as if he could dislodge the memory, As if Grid View hadn’t made it a permanent fixture in his mind. “Once I catch this fucker, I will be.”This book is hosted on another platform. Read the official version and support the author's work.

Hel and Latham exchanged worried looks. “From your lips to Arkola’s ears,” Latham said. “So I’ll say again. What’s your play?”

“I’ve apparently got a meeting with some grand wanker called the Warden of the Reserves scheduled for this morning,” Lowe glanced at his watch. “Right about now, in fact.” He stood and offered his hand to his friends. “Cheers for the boost today, guys. I really appreciated it. Not all the bullshit comedy routine around it, but, you know. Thank you.”

Latham grabbed a sandwich and stood. “You want some back-up? Be just like old times.”

“Not this time, mate.”

“Look, far be it from me to be a hand wringing panty-wetter, but I don’t think you should be walking around on your own, little man. Even with that,” he pointed at the manacle, “you’re still far too squishy for my liking. Anyone that can rob the Vault and leave your name in the mouth of a ticking timebomb is going to be worth keeping an eye out for.”

“Appreciate it, but I actually have someone else to ride shotgun on this one. Figure I owe him that much.”

***

"You know, I don't get out too much in the daylight anymore," Rook said, pulling his overcoat around himself self-consciously. "You’re sure you want me in on this?"  

They were sitting outside the most expensive office Lowe had ever seen. The whole building made some of the better houses in Jewel Town look like slums. The domed building towered over the rest of the street, all polished marble and enchanted glass. And once inside this place, money didn’t just talk—it dictated the laws of reality. 

Lowe looked again at the golden plaque in the middle of the heavy double door: Warden of the Reserves, Aven Morholt. Sovereign Bank of Soar.

“You got the same message as me," Lowe said, watching Rook pull his coat tighter around himself. "If the Black Knight is back, then you know as much about him as I do.”  

And that was true, wasn’t it?

Rook had been the key information officer in the investigation, the one who was tasked with spotting things others didn’t. Not just because he worked harder than anyone—though he did. Not just because he followed the threads until his fingers bled—though he had. 

No, Rook had a Skill for it. Pattern Recognition. It wasn’t flashy. It didn’t set off fireworks in a fight, but it had saved plenty of lives. It was the reason their squad had suspected the Black Knight was going to change it up and look to take a child after all.

They’d been pouring over data for weeks, looking for a pattern in the killings that had been plaguing the well-to-do of Jewel Town. The victims had all been bankers, politicians, a few trade officials. A brutal, methodical culling of the rich and famous and each murder had been staged and heavily dramatic. 

The Black Knight was the name on everyone’s lips. Lowe wasn’t surprised the Temple Warders had been put on alert. Dropping an Avatar would have been right up that wanker’s street. 

He was the dashing shadow who stole from the rich and . . . well, if he hadn’t got around to giving to the poor yet, then that was surely just a matter of time. So much so, in fact, that it would be fair to say that the level of public interest in catching the guy was massively inversely proportional to how much pressure was being put on Cuckoo House from the Mayor’s office.

Lowe had assumed—wrongly, as it turned out in the end—that the next target would be another figure at the top of society. Someone high-profile. Another statement kill.  

But it had been Rook who had been the one to make the necessary intuitive leap.  

"Not the powerful," he had said to Lowe, running into his office carrying a case file, eyes fever-bright. "Not this time. I think he’s going to target the protected."  

And just like that, they had almost got ahead of the bastard. Almost. 

But they hadn’t been able to predict which kid he’d take. They hadn’t guessed it would be the Highberg’s child who would be the one taken.  

Lowe saw the way Rook's fingers flexed, remembered the way they had clenched back then—white-knuckled, shaking, pressing against his forehead as though he could force the truth into place faster.  

Rook had blamed himself when the report of the kidnapping had come through.  They’d been so close to preventing it.

Just as Lowe blamed himself for what had happened in the park. And for what had been left in the warehouse.  

For the things neither of them had stopped. 

Which was why, if Lowe was going to finally bring this guy down, he was going to ensure that Rook was going to be right by his side.

“I probably should have asked this beforehand, but did you retain your Abilities when you, you know, came back from the dead?”

“Fraid not. New Class, new rules, Lowe. Everything I’ve got now is a bit more . . . shall we say ‘death orientated?’”

“Actually, shall we not say that?” Lowe said, as the door to the office opened. “It sounds fucking creepy.”

A willowy blonde wearing glasses and holding a clipboard appeared in the doorway, her expression politely neutral. Her suit was white and crisp, her posture impeccable, and the glint of a … was that a warding pin on her lapel told Lowe she wasn’t just here to take notes. 

Bodyguard? he thought. Was it usual practice for the PA of the Warden of the Reserve to have game?

“Mr. Morholt will see you now,” she said.

Lowe stood. Rook hesitated, fingers tapping against the arm of his chair in a nervous rhythm before he sighed and followed suit, pulling his coat even tighter around himself.  

The blonde had already stepped aside, turning on her heel and pushing back through the doors, expecting them to follow without question. The hallway beyond was exactly as Lowe had expected—polished marble floors, chandeliers with bound-light enchantments, and the hush of wealth.

Rook muttered under his breath as they walked. “How the other half live, eh?”  

But Lowe wasn’t really paying attention anymore. His gaze had drifted upward—to the soaring ceilings, to the intricate carvings of celestial constellations inlaid above them. And somewhere up there, through the massive arched windows that overlooked the city, the Celestial Temple gleamed.  

Then there was a bright flicker. A twinkling of the light.  

Coincidence?  

Or was someone watching?

            







	***





                The office of Aven Morholt, Warden of the Reserve, was not what Lowe had expected.  

Given the ridiculous opulence on display in the rest of the building, he’d anticipated something particularly grand. An overstuffed chair made from something extinct. A desk so large it could double as a duelling platform. Giant paintings of Mr Morholt looking ever so patriarchal positioned, imposingly across every inch of the walls.

However, the reality was surprisingly different. 

As much as it pained Lowe to note, the space was actually quite tasteful. Restrained. Understated, even. And in the way only true wealth could actually afford to be. The office was all dark wood, soft lighting, and with an antique grandfather clock ticking away happily on the far wall. Even the sigil of the Sovereign Bank of Soar was a simple brass plate affixed behind Morholt’s desk rather than an ostentatious display.  

Money talks, Lowe thought, but the kind that lasts doesn’t need to shout about it.

Morholt himself sat behind the desk, a big, heavyset man whose bushy mustache and small eyes made him look like a walrus who had taken a brief but promising detour into human affairs. He was impeccably dressed, of course—tailored waistcoat, polished cufflinks, and the whiff of expensive aftershave clinging to the air—but,  even so, there seemed to be a tightness to him. Which was weird considering, as far as Lowe had been able to ascertain, the Sovereign Bank had pretty much insisted to Staffen that he personally attended this meeting. A faint sheen of sweat stood out on his forehead that suggested he was very much not enjoying the prospect of talking to him. 

That or he was just hot, Lowe thought. Sometimes, you could read too much into body language. 

Then he felt the massive impact of someone aiming an absolute cannon of a mental skill at him, and he started to rethink his opinion. 

Someone in this room really wasn’t happy to be answering questions. 

A squeezing attack tried to snap around his brain, seeking to tighten like the ghost of a noose. It sought to move downwards, coiling over his arms, around his ribs, and the white-hot fire of the psychic attack was weightless and crushing all at once. However, even as Mental Fortress shredded through the attack, effortlessly swatting aside the attack, something else kicked in.  

The manacle around his wrist went ice-cold and The Board is Set triggered.  

Pressure.  

It wasn’t pain. Wasn’t damage. But it felt epically heavy around his chest as it was stored. Banked, Lowe supposed, like some sort of unseen reserve. A tension curled through his limbs as he could feel the chain waiting to be used. It was holding still, but it didn’t want to hold for long. The pain of the attack might be gone, but the Pressure remained.  

That was… interesting.

But not as interesting as the fact that either Morholt or his blonde PA had just tried to influence him. Fuck influence. Someone in this room had just tried to lobotomise him. 

He looked to Rook on his right. If the attack had hit him too, there was no sign of it. Maybe Threshold Guardian’s had some sort of natural defence against mental attacks? Once again, he wished he’d spent a bit longer learning about his friend’s new Class before blundering into this meeting. As it was, Rook was simply looking vaguely uncomfortable and was continuing to fidget with his coat.

Lowe turned his attention to the blonde, Miss St. Clair. Morholt’s personal assistant. A quick check showed Personal Assistant, Level 13 floating above her head.

Lowe had come across plenty of low-level assistants in his time. This was not one of them.  

The young woman stood off to the side, clipboard in hand, expression cool. But it was the way she stood that set off alarm bells in Lowe’s head. Too balanced. Too still. She reminded him very much of Hel. And Hel could hide her Level and Class.

So she was definitely a bodyguard. Maybe an assassin? Probably both.

And she hadn’t so much as pretended to look Lowe in the eye since they’d entered the room. 

For shits and giggles, Lowe concentrated and turned the Pressure into Retaliation, interested to see who it would focus upon. His manacle suddenly heated up as he let the power of that mental attack back towards its point of origin. Yeah, suddenly Miss St. Clair wasn’t so disinterested in him anymore. The mental impact damn near knocked her off her feet.

“Are you okay, Miss St. Clair?” Morholt asked as the woman visibly swayed against his desk.

“Absolutely fine, Mr Morholt. I just went a little light-headed there for a moment.”

Morholt blinked at her for a moment and then steepled his fingers before him in what was clearly a well-practiced expression of concern. “As you can imagine, Inspector Lower, this whole thing had been a huge shock for everyone at Sovereign Bank,” he said, his voice a rich velvety baritone. “It has been years since there has even been so much of an attempt at a robbery at one of our institutions. Let alone a successful one! For the Vault to have been emptied out in such a fashion is . . . appalling.”  

“Appalling,” Lowe said. “Yes, I am sure.”

“And as for the loss of life . . .” Morholt sighed again. But it was all a performance, Lowe thought. A man playing at being troubled by all the death rather than there being any real emotional weight to it. He wondered what the Warden of Reserves wanted out of forcing this meeting. Time to stir that particular pot. 

“I wonder what you are able to tell me about the deceased, sir?” Lowe asked, hoping Rook was watching the P.A’s reaction carefully. He was very much focused on Morholt.

The banker’s brow furrowed slightly, but not in grief, more in mild irritation. He really didn’t want to go down this road at all, did he? “The deceased? I’m sorry, I don’t understand. I am afraid I have absolutely no idea about the individuals at all.”

Miss St. Clair, having regained her composure, flicked through the pages on her clipboard and put a piece of paper before her boss. Morholt did not so much as glance at, batting it away. He didn’t seem especially delighted that the woman was hovering so close to him, did he? Guilty? Scared?

“This is all a regrettable situation, for sure,” he said smoothly, as though he were discussing an unfortunate clerical error rather than a massacre. “But I have not asked you here today to talk about the deaths. And, in any event, I have been assured that all proper reparations are being made to the families of our lost employees. That is correct, is it not, Miss St. Clair?”

“I appreciate it might not be on the agenda, but just for my own clarity,” Lowe said, before the woman had time to speak. “I would like to know a little more about those who were slain. I’m funny that way.”

“He is,” Rook said. “Not funny ha ha, perhaps. But he always does get worked up about dead bodies. It’s a fault.”

Morholt frowned, then nodded at St. Clair. “Tell him what he wants to know.”

“Lead Clerk Jaron Whitlow, aged fifty-six,” she said, voice crisp. “Branch Security Officer Harlen Vost, thirty-two. Senior Account Manager Ellise Drennan, forty-two. Several junior clerks, three interns, six accountants including, of course, Mr Stern, and a number of—” she paused, glancing briefly at Lowe. “—customers. We are, of course, not free to share information about those. However, if this is something you are especially interested in, I am sure that we would be happy for you to have the personnel files of our ex-employees. Would that would be helpful?”  Support the author by searching for the original publication of this novel.

A stack of files appeared on the desk and Lowe transferred them into his inventory. “Yes. Most helpful. Thank you.”

“I have to say, though, I am not sure I understand the purpose of looking at the people,” Morholt said. “It’s not like any of the dead bodies emptied the Vault is it? We all know who did that, don’t we?”

“Perhaps,” Rook said. “But you must recognise that it appears you are oddly unconcerned about the fate of those who worked for you.”  

Morholt spread his hands. “What can I say? The whole thing was a tragedy. An undoubted horror. But you must understand, Inspector, my first priority - indeed the basis of my whole Class - is to secure the Bank’s interests. There are others -” he waved a hand airily in a gesture which, regrettably, looked nothing so much as if he was requesting his next fish supper - “who I am sure will be concerned with the . . . erm, the human details. However, assets can be recovered. Lives, regrettably, cannot. Therefore, from my point of view, there is no sense at all in dwelling on what cannot be undone.”  

“No sense at all,” Lowe echoed.

Morholt gave a small nod, entirely missing—or entirely ignoring—the disgust curling around Lowe’s words.  

“Now,” Morholt said, making another flappy gesture for St. Clair to come forward. “Perhaps we can move on to what I have requested your presence here today for?”

Miss St. Clair laid another file in front of Lowe. But this one was different. It was bound in supple black leather, embossed with the Sovereign Bank’s sigil in gold leaf. Much more impressive than the ones that held the human details. She opened it for him with a flick of her fingers before taking a step back, once again assuming her carefully neutral posture.

This file did not contain a ledger of names, nor was it a straightforward financial spreadsheet. At least, not in any way that made immediate sense to Lowe. 

He flicked through the pages, eyes scanning the words, trying to find something to give what he was being shown real context. Instead, however, he found himself looking at rows upon rows of generic, unclear descriptors. They were vague and infuriatingly unhelpful.  

Asset ID: 00012-F  

- Category: Secured Holdings  

- Description: Archival Material (High Sensitivity)  

- Disbursement Status: Unauthorised Removal  

Lowe flipped to another page.  

Asset ID: 09384-K  

- Category: Restricted Inventory  

- Description: Unclassified Object (Internal Reference Only)  

- Disbursement Status: Breach Confirmed  

A third entry.  

Asset ID: 57921-X  

- Category: Contingency Stock  

- Description: Executive Access Required  

- Disbursement Status: Clearance Violation Pending Review  

"I’m sorry, Mr Morholt, what am I looking at here?"

There were no itemised values, no specific breakdowns, no actual descriptions of what had been stolen—only a collection of deliberately vague, bureaucratic labels. It was almost impressively unhelpful.  

Almost.  

“Naturally, certain details must remain confidential,” Morholt said with oily insincerity.  

“Hang on. Let me get this straight,” Lowe said. “You’ve clearly pulled rank to get me here today because you want me to recover something. Fair dues, not the first time that has happened. But it would be oddly unique for me not to be told what it is I’m looking for?”  

Miss St. Clair didn’t move, but Lowe caught the barest flicker of amusement in her eyes before it was gone.  

Morholt dabbed at his forehead with his handkerchief. “I believe you are an intelligent man, Inspector. I’m sure you will manage. When you locate the . . . the Black Knight, you will doubtless find the assets contained in that folder. When you do, you are not to examine them in any way. You are, instead, to contact me personally. Do you understand?”  

“Oh, absolutely,” he said. “I’ll just keep an eye out for a mysterious unclassified object of high sensitivity that requires executive access and has been stolen by persons unknown. Now I think of it, that really narrows things down. I’ll probably have this knocked out by lunchtime.”  

Morholt’s mustache twitched. Miss St. Clair remained still. Rook let out a quiet chuckle.

“Well,” Lowe said, tapping a finger on the folder and standing, “this has been illuminating.”  

“I trust you understand the discretion required,” Morholt said, noticeably not rising. “And, to make things worth your while, I want to make it clear that the Bank’s sole interest is in those assets. Any gold that may or may not have been within the Vault is neither here nor there.”  

“Oh, loud and clear,” Lowe said, pulling the folder into his inventory.

He didn’t miss the way Miss St. Clair’s fingers twitched. If he had to guess, she had been expecting him to leave the folder behind. But he wasn’t feeling that cooperative.

This meeting had never been about all the lives lost in the Vault. To this man, they were just irritating collateral damage. Unfortunate statistics in an event that had rocked the bank to its foundations. Morholt wanted Lowe here because something had been taken, not to actually find a murderer.

Then St. Clair adjusted her glasses and something else brushed against Lowe’s mind. He let it sit as Pressure for now as she spoke. “For absolute clarity, Mr Lowe, the Warden is asking you, in a private capacity, to work with Sovereign Bank on this matter.” she said. She might as well have been dictating meeting minutes for all the emotion in it. “Whilst he understands that you will, doubtless, have conflicting loyalties with the Security Services, he does not wish there to be any muddiness here. You can catch The Black Knight for Cuckoo House, but you recover the assets for the Bank. And anything else you find is yours to keep. Isn’t that right, sir?”  

Lowe turned his head just in time to see the sweat on Morholt’s brow go from a damp sheen to a visible stream.  

“Yes, Miss St. Clair,” Morholt said quickly, dabbing at his forehead with a silk handkerchief. “That is perfectly right. Just… let me know, personally, Lowe, when you have a line on the sneaky bastard and, well, we will not be unappreciative.”  

Lowe watched the way Morholt tried to maintain his composure, but the Warden of the Reserves was utterly rattled. Whatever had been taken, it was something big.

“I can assure you, sir,” Lowe said, “that when I bring the murderer of all those people to justice, everyone who needs to know about it, will be informed.” Morholt opened his mouth, but Lowe wasn’t finished. “If, at the same time, I happen to stumble upon some unnamed trinkets—” he let the words hang there “—I will, of course, ensure they return to  . . . their rightful owner.”   

The sweat on Morholt’s brow thickened, trickling down his temple as he adjusted his collar with a nervous cough. And then Lowe let the Pressure go.  

St. Clair stumbled. Not as much as last time. Barely a falter, really. But it was there. And this time, she reacted. Lowe saw it in the tightening of her jaw, the sudden fury in her eyes as she straightened too quickly, her grip on her clipboard going white-knuckled. No polite neutrality anymore. Just raw, unfiltered rage.  

If looks could kill, Lowe would already be ashes. And he suspected she might be taking that beyond mere looks in the near future. It was always good to make new friends.

Rook must have noticed something too, because he pushed back from his own chair, and moved to stand between the two of them. “Well,” he said, “that was just as delightful as I think we all expected it would be. Should we show ourselves out?”  

Morholt cleared his throat, clearly trying to regain control of the room. “We appreciate your time, Inspector and, I’m sorry, I’m not sure I know who you are?”

“That makes two of us,” Rook said.

Morholt clearly didn’t know what to make of that. “Well, we will await your… findings.”  

Lowe nodded back. He was buttoning his coat as he turned for the door, with Rook ahead of him. The delectable Miss St. Clair hadn’t moved from her spot next to the Warden, but Lowe could feel her watching them, feel the white hot wrath roiling off her as she stepped forward to usher them toward the exit.  

“Inspector?” she said.  

Lowe stopped. Half turned.  

Her expression had smoothed back into something neutral, but there was intent behind it now. A razor-edge of warning just beneath the surface. “I’ll be in touch,” she said.  

It wasn’t a question.  

Lowe gave her his best lazy grin. “Looking forward to it.” This didn’t seem to improve relations. 

Then they were stepping through the door to leave the office of the Warden of the Reserves behind.

“Did that fucker just try to bribe you?” Rook asked as they walked away.

“Right after the blonde tried to kill me. Twice.”

“Really? 

“Really.”

“Fuck. You’re life’s ain’t dull, is it?”

“Tell me about it.”

            







	***





                Following that joyous meeting, Lowe had returned to Cuckoo House. 

He spent the next few bells buried in the personnel files from the Bank, flipping through hundreds of pages with a patience that he didn’t actually feel. He wasn’t exactly expecting to find any great revelation buried within all the information Morholt had begrudgingly provided, but he had learned the hard way that sometimes the smallest detail—some forgotten note, a discrepancy in a report—could be the key to unlocking something bigger.  

He’d left Rook with the other folder—the redacted one—and they’d agreed to catch up later.  

Lowe wasn’t convinced there could be all that much to gain from a collection of intentionally vague descriptions, but the Threshold Guardian had been keen to take a look. And, frankly, Lowe couldn’t think of a good reason to say ‘no.’ If Rook wanted to waste his time cross-referencing nonsense, that was his look-out. 

Still, the way Morholt had sweated when Lowe had pressed him about the missing assets lingered in his mind. Something in that folder was important enough that the Warden of the Reserves had all but begged him to let the Bank handle it privately. That meant someone—and very much the wrong someone—had taken something they weren’t supposed to have.  

As Lowe had expected, though, there was nothing in the mound of discarded paperwork growing around him that was ringing his bell. That should have been reassuring. But it wasn’t. Because somewhere, naggingly, at the back of his mind, an itch was developing about all this. 

He felt he had noticed something important and, since he had recently levelled up his Intellect and Wisdom to a significant degree, he figured it would be worth listening to gut instinct.

Just because his conscious mind hadn’t caught up with things yet, didn’t mean it wasn’t there. 

Lowe rescanned his notes, feeling the dull ache of fatigue creeping in behind his eyes.  He remembered what his old commander, Cenorth, had drilled into him, the memory of his voice cutting through the years as sharply as it had in the field.  

"Stop looking for what jumps out at you, Lowe. That’s how you get caught up in distractions—half-truths, red herrings, misdirections some bastard planted just for you to find. The real trick? Look for what isn’t there. The details that should be, but aren’t. The story they ‘forgot’ to tell."  

Lowe could still picture him, pacing the length of his dingy office in Cuckoo House, hands clasped behind his back, boots scuffing the floorboards with each deliberate step. There had always been an edge to Cenorth, a simmering, controlled violence beneath the surface, but when he talked shop—when he dissected a case, peeling it open layer by layer—he was something else entirely.  

"Most people think investigations are about piecing things together. They’re wrong. It’s about picking them apart. People try too hard to make things make sense. That’s where they go wrong. When something doesn't fit, doesn't feel quite right? That’s where you start digging. That’s where the bodies are buried."

Of course, Cenorth had turned out to be the sneakiest of all the bastards. Not only had he tried to set Lowe up for all sorts of bollocks, he’d nearly murdered Arebella and, generally, been a pretty bad guy. Which rather took the shine off all those little pearls of wisdom. Still, a stopped clock was right twice a day. And, attempted murder aside, the advice had been solid.

Lowe started with Lead Clerk Jaron Whitlow, aged fifty-six. He’d been with the bank for twenty-seven years. A lifetime spent in the quiet, meticulous world of ledgers and balance sheets. From everything Lowe read, Whitlow had been the man who made the Vault run smoothly—not with ambition, but with reliability. He had spent his career quietly correcting the numbers of his betters, ensuring decimal points never slipped, that accounts always squared, that the great machinery of wealth continued its relentless churn.  

There was not a single black mark on his record. No disciplinary actions. Not even a whispered reprimand for lateness. He had never taken a sick day. Never filed a complaint. Never so much as raised his voice in the workplace. By all accounts, he had been someone the Bank hierarchy had liked because he never caused trouble and the kind coworkers trusted because he never let things fall apart. Lowe grimaced at the final page. Whitlow’s pension paperwork had already been filed. Six weeks from retirement. And now he was very, very dead.  

There was nothing else there. No secret debts. No suspicious connections. No reason—no reason at all—for Jaron Whitlow to now be lying in the Vault with his head exploded around a massive fucking grin.

Lowe paused, letting the info run through his mind. Was there anything in this file that was causing the itch? Anything in that litany of blameless service? No. No he didn’t think there was.If you come across this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.

Lowe closed that file and turned to a new one. Branch Security Officer Harlen Vost. Thirty-two and a former Soldier. Compared to Whitlow, he had a far shorter amount of service. There was nothing noteworthy recorded in the file about the man’s time in the military. No medals. No dramatic battlefield heroics. No scandalous discharge. Just another young man who had done his time, served competently, and then slipped back into civilian life like countless others before him.  

Vost’s transition into security work had been predictable. Ex-military types gravitated toward jobs like this—low-risk, steady pay and work that required discipline but rarely called for real danger. He’d taken the job at the bank three years ago and, according to his appraisals, had done it pretty well.  

His personnel file was dry, almost painfully so. Two commendations for diligence, both from supervisors who had praised his attentiveness and steady hand. A single minor note about an altercation with a drunk customer, though it had been ruled justified—Vost had done nothing excessive, had followed protocol to the letter.  There was nothing in his record that suggested he might have been involved in what had happened. 

Just a man who had signed up to guard a bank and ended up dead inside it.

Lowe could feel his frustration rising. He picked up another of the files he’d already gone through. Senior Account Manager Ellise Drennan. 

A forty-something widow with one daughter, currently studying at the University of Soar. That had interested him, initially, and he’d spent a bit of time tracking her down. For all the good that did him. She was a promising student from what little information Lowe could find, studying Manatechnical Finance, likely seeking to follow in her mother’s footsteps. Although probably not all the way to the exact same conclusion . . .

Drennan had worked at the Vault for nearly two decades, steadily rising through the ranks. Not because she had been a careerist, not because she had played cutthroat politics or courted favour with the right people, but because she had been good. Steady. Trustworthy. Someone clients didn’t just rely on but confided in. She had handled high-value clientele—those who preferred their assets unlisted, their transactions discreet, and their records conveniently opaque. That didn’t mean she was involved in anything illegal—at least, there was no sign of it—but it did mean she had been trusted. He bet she’d have been able to tell him what was on the list Morholt had passed over.

She’d been the quintessential safe pair of hands.  Another reliable employee. No complaints against her. No whispers of scandal. No cause for grudges Lowe could see. Nothing in her file suggested enemies. Nothing at all.  

Lowe sighed, closing the file and picking up another as he continued reading.  

Several junior clerks. Three interns. Six accountants. All with similar profiles. All ordinary. All people who had come to work that day expecting it to be like any other. Nothing jumped out to suggest there was anything unusual in them. 

And yet, they were all dead.

And then there was Elias Stern.  

Lowe flipped through the personnel file, his fingers drumming lightly against the edge of the page.  

Elias Stern. Fifty-five years old. Nearly twenty years with the bank. No significant promotions, no disciplinary actions, and no flagged transactions. A quiet, steady career in the way only an Accountant’s could be. His gaze dropped lower. No military background. No history of mental instability. No ties to radical organisations. No unusual purchases. No large debts.  

Activating Grid View, Lowe reviewed the man’s last few moments. The way he had looked. His expression, the tremor in his voice, the sweat gathering at his temple. The way his hands had shaken—but not with fear. With something else. 

Resignation. 

And then the growing grin. The explosion. The moment of silence before his head—his whole skull—had torn itself apart in a flash of blood. The way his body had collapsed inward, leaving nothing but ruin.  

Lowe’s head was starting to ache. He’d been sitting here too long. He wondered if Rook was having more luck with his folder of redacted info. He certainly couldn’t be doing any worse.  

Lowe’s eyes drifted back to Stern’s personnel file. He scanned the page again, as if rereading the same words would suddenly give them new meaning. His fingers hesitated over a line in the report.  

Elias Stern, Fifty-Five.  

Fifty-five.  

The number caught in his head, snagging on something just beyond reach.  

Fifty-five.  

Lowe’s frown deepened.  

He sat back in his chair, closing his eyes for a moment, letting the memory settle in properly.  

The man he had spoken to in the Vault—the one who had looked him in the eye, named the Black Knight, and then self-destructed—hadn’t been old. He hadn’t had thinning hair or the slightly stooped posture of someone who had spent two decades hunched over ledgers.  

He fucking well hadn’t been fifty-five.  

Lowe turned back to the file, flicking through the pages with fresh intent, looking for an image. Of course there wasn’t one. There wasn’t in any of the files. He retriggered Grid View. The Accountant he had seen, the man who had murdered an entire bank floor’s worth of people, had been younger. Mid-thirties at most.  

That wasn’t Elias Stern.

Which meant the killer—the one who had executed his colleagues, whispered Lowe’s name, and turned his own head into a firebomb—had been someone else.  

Someone using Stern’s name. And able to spoof his profession and level.

Who the fuck had murdered those people?

            







	***





                "Call me a bluff old traditionalist, Lant, but I kind of assumed that, when identifying bodies, you might have, I don't know, some sort of fucking process you use by which to ensure some degree of accuracy!"  

Lowe’s voice echoed off the tile, bouncing between the exposed pipes and low-hanging light fixtures of the Deathcaller’s mortuary. The smell was as bad as ever—a rancid, chemical mix of rot and preservation fluids - and that was even before it got to Lant’s stench itself. 

Soar’s Deathcaller - Penarth Lant - was, on his best day, a goblin-shaped stain on Lowe’s peace of mind. Today was not shaping up to be one of those.

"Inspector, Inspector, Inspector.” Lant said, voice oily with condescension. “You always did have a charming way of implying incompetence when you simply didn’t understand something too complicated for your silly little mind. It’s a shame to see that your fall from grace didn’t do anything to adjust that.”  

"Oh, forgive me, you lecherous piece of shit! I was under the naive impression that when you, personally, are in charge of identifying dead bodies, you might actually inform those of us responsible for investigating murders what’s in your cold storage before we go out there with our facts wrong! If you don’t clear this up for me, right now, my next stop is Staffen’s office and I think we both know she’s just itching for the opportunity to rip your balls off and stuff them up your arse!"  

Lant didn’t flinch. He never flinched. The man had all the social instincts of a carrion bird—he just stared back. "Inspector,” Lant said, “As I have been trying to explain to you, since you appeared here in your customary shambolic way. As far as the massacre in the Vault is concerned, I haven’t told Cuckoo House a damn thing yet.”  

Lowe stopped mid-rant. “...What?”  

The Deathcaller rolled his eyes and waddled over to a drip-covered gurney, his wide belly shifting as he moved. He gestured vaguely at the row of bodies covered in stained cloth. Some were largely intact, others… less so.  

“I,” Lant continued, “am still in the process of establishing a clear, confirmed identity for each of these poor,  headless souls. Which means that any presumptions made by your little nest of underpaid malcontents”—he waggled his fingers in the air dismissively—“were nothing to do with my office at all.”  

Lowe blinked. Then blinked again.  

“You’re telling me,” Lowe said slowly, “that Cuckoo House has already filed identification on all these bodies… without you signing off on it?"  

“Absolutely. Quite hilarious, isn’t it?”  

Lowe could feel his head pounding as all of his righteous indignation drained away. “So let me just get this straight," he said. "You’ve been sitting on a pile of unidentified corpses, and instead of actually doing your fucking job—”  

“Hang on, Lowe. My fucking job?" Lant interrupted. "First you come in here telling me I’ve fucked up by not identifying these wankers properly. And now you want to pivot to balling me out for not doing it quickly enough? Are you fucking kidding me? It’s not my fault you guys jumped the gun. What I’ve been doing in the handful of fucking bells since this lot were dropped off here is, first and foremost, making sure they’re actually deceased . . .” 

“Oh, don't start with your weird-ass definitions of death, Lant—”  

“You’d be amazed at how many bodies are only mostly dead, Inspector—”  

“Not the point! The point is, you’re letting an entire department move an investigation forward assuming the corpses have been positively identified, and you didn’t think to mention to anyone that was absolute bollocks?”  

“Ah, Lowe. You are, as ever, a treat.” He made an exaggerated flourish toward the bodies. “You see, these are my problem. You and your fellow investigators acting like complete tossrags is - and I cannot stress this enough - absolutely not my circus. I don’t like sharing unfinished work. The fact Cuckoo House is happy making assumptions about who was to be found amongst that slaughter is neither my purview, nor my issue. I really hope none of your colleagues have informed the next of kin yet. I’m sure it would be . . . awkward should any of that needed to be walked back."  

Lowe stared at him.

Lant stared back.  

"You," Lowe said, "are a horrible, horrible little man."  

Lant’s grin widened into something deeply unsettling. “Why, thank you, Inspector. I do try.”  

The worst of it was that Lant was right. If assumption was the mother of all fuck-ups, then Lowe had made a big one here. He’d gone off to see the Warden of Reserves assuming that the bodies were bank staff and customers. Not that anyone had suggested anything otherwise to him. And Morholt and St. Claire had obviously thought that too. 

Hadn’t they?

And what about Elias Stern? Or, more to point, not Elias Stern.

What the fuck had he stumbled into here? And how in Soar was the Black Knight involved?

“Okay,” Lowe said, voice forcing himself to be calm. They’d jumped the gun. He needed to get things back on track “So, let’s resolve this, shall we? What, exactly, do you have here?”  

Lant sighed dramatically, as if he were being deeply inconvenienced, and waddled toward the nearest corpse. He pulled back the stained sheet with an air of theatricality, revealing… something that might have once been a man.  

The stump around its head was blackened. Twisted. Charred beyond recognition.  Lant waved a hand over the body. “As you can see, other than losing his head at the wrong moment, this chap is positively pristine. Extremely fit. Very athletic. I tell you what, you should have a look at one of the girls. If I leave the bag over her head I can almost get interested.”  

“Can we do this without the colour commentary please, your fucking chaos goblin?”  

"Ah-ah!" Lant wagged a finger. “Temper, Inspector. We mustn’t be unprofessional. As all the little HR meetings I keep having tell me. Respect in all things. No, what is interesting here is that this chap,” Lant gestured to all the other bodies packed around them, “and all of the other lads and lasses is that not only are they headless, but they appear to be fingerprintless too.”This tale has been pilfered from Royal Road. If found on Amazon, kindly file a report.

“I don’t understand.”

“No, I’m sure you don’t. I’m using all sorts of complex polysyllables, aren’t I? Would it help if I drew you a picture? Maybe if I located a more than usually dim eight-year-old to explain it to you? You know, someone on your level?”

Lowe bit down on his tongue. “You’re saying, Lant, that none of the bodies in the Vault have fingerprints?”

“No. No, they don’t. Isn’t that interesting? It seems that whoever killed them succeeded in not only removing their faces, but also any identifying marks at all. I have to say, I respect that sort of thoroughness.  That’s a Skill I think we can all agree would be very helpful indeed, in certain circumstances. Now, perhaps, you will appreciate why my report to Cuckoo House is, as yet, somewhat incomplete.”  

“No faces. No fingerprints,” Lowe said. “So you’re telling me you do not have a way of figuring out who all these people actually are?”  

Lant beamed, as if this was the exact question he had been waiting for. “Oh, don’t despair, dearest Inspector! I am no mere Graveteller. You stand before Penarth Lant, the foremost Deathcaller in all of Soar. I am not so easily discouraged. However . . .”

“However, what?”

“However, you haven’t asked nicely.”  

A silence stretched. Rage swelled deep in his chest, rising like a goddamn volcano—  

"Fine," Lowe gritted out, with all the warmth of a dying sun. “Please, oh mighty Deathcaller, if it isn’t too much trouble, would you be so kind as to share your deeply insightful wisdom about the actual, proper identities of the people who died in the Vault?”  

Lant giggled. Fucking giggled. Then, with obnoxious levels of satisfaction, he flicked through a stack of notes, pulled one free, and tapped it against his palm.  

“Well, Inspector, since you grovelled so prettily—”  

“For the record, I absolutely hate you.”  

“—I will, out of the graciousness of my heart, reveal to you that at least five of these bodies are not who I was told they were supposed to be.”

“What do you mean by that?”  

“I mean, Inspector,” he said, voice thick with mock patience, “that the initial report I was given about what occurred in the Vault suggested that I would be examining the corpses of a bunch of bank workers and a number of well-to-do customers. As is policy, the mana signature of all those who are employed by Soar Bank are on record and, I can tell you, they are absolutely not a match for the first five bodies I have been able to complete the required activation ritual over.”

“Okay, so you’ve started with five customers, then?”

“What a lovely example of the legendary Lowe intuition I have heard so much about over the years! It really is a pleasure to see a master in action.”

“Fuck off!”

“I do wonder,” Lant mused, “if I’m not the only one who would benefit from a course in Sensitivity Training, Inspector. But hey ho, never mind.Yes, indeed, it was my assumption I had, coincidentally, picked out five customers first. Five beheaded corpses. Five hapless customers in the Vault at the wrong place and at the wrong time. Tragic, really.” He flicked a page over with obnoxious precision. “So imagine my delight when I was actually able to find records of these five particular ‘customers.’”  

Lowe didn’t miss the inverted commas. “Why ‘customers?’”  

"Because, Inspector," Lant said, "I do so enjoy accuracy in language.” He waddled toward a workbench cluttered with stacks of parchment and the charred remnants of personal effects, fingers twitching over a burned leather bag. “And while these five individuals were present in the Vault during the unfortunate events of that evening, it appears that in the strictest sense … none of them were actual customers.”  

“Excuse me?”  

Lant placed a hand to his chest like a put-upon saint. “I know! Shocking. You’d think a Vault would contain actual Vault clients, but no. Turns out, these five had no registered holdings at the Sovereign Bank, no active accounts, no transaction history—and yet, they were all in the Vault at the exact moment of the unfortunate massacre.”  

Lowe looked around at all the bodies. What were the chances that the first five bodies Lant tried to identify would not be workers at the Bank. There were what? Twenty-five? Thirty bodies here? And what about that fucking Accountant? He hadn’t been who he said he’d been either . . .

Lant was continuing with his lecture. “Well, naturally, I assumed these five ladies and gentlemen must have been extremely important. High rollers. Perhaps private Vault clients with… unusual ledgers. So I did what any diligent Deathcaller would do. I cross-referenced their mana signatures with some of my more . . . secret databases. And would you believe it?” He spread his hands, voice dripping with faux innocence. “Every single one of them matched a sealed record.”  

“Sealed?”  

“Oh yes, Inspector.” Lant rocked back on his heels, satisfaction rolling off him in waves. “And not just lightly sealed. Not minor-bureaucratic-inconvenience sealed. No, these files are to be found in a vault within the Vault sort of sealed. The kind that doesn’t like being opened.”  

"Lant," Lowe said, voice edged with warning, "what kind of records are we talking about?"  

Lant paused and put a finger to his lips and clearly activated some sort of Skill, Mental Fortress dispelling what Lowe assumed was some sort of Silence Ability. “Now, whilst I do not necessarily believe that the walls have ears, I do not want to take any chances. Should anyone be eavesdropping on us, they will simply hear us continuing our line of amusing banter.”

“Okay . . .” Lowe felt Lant’s Skill turn into Pressure via his manacle. He had a moment wondering how fun it would be to sit Lant down on his arse, but then restrained himself. The Deathcaller was being helpful for once. “So what sort of records are they?”

“Military, dear heart. Military. And while it is entirely plausible that a member of the military might find themselves in the Vault at the wrong moment…” He lifted a scalpel from the workbench and twirled it theatrically between his fingers. "And even two might be possible. But five out of five of the ‘customers’ I’ve examined thus far?" Lant's grin was grim. "Well, Inspector, I’ll leave that up to your own brilliant little brain to unpick.”

What the fuck? There were five members of Soar’s Military in the Vault when it was robbed blind? 

“Lant, I swear to every god listening, if you are wrong about this, I will make sure that sensitivity training is the least of your problems.”  

Lant gasped in mock horror, clutching his considerable belly. “You wound me, sir! Oh, I, too, thought it must be a mistake at first. A bureaucratic hiccup, perhaps. A case of clerical incompetence. Impossible, I know, given how well-run our institutions are. But, when I realised all five of our dearly departed ‘customers’ had their mana prints tied to sealed military records, I began to lose all my curiosity in this situation. Why, should it turn out that everyone in this death heap have their own files, I imagine I will forget any of this happened at all.”  

Lowe couldn’t blame him. This was some deep shit.

The Vault robbery. The Black Knight. The unidentified Accountant, and now this? Five, at least, military personnel - with sealed records - in the wrong place at the wrong time . . . except, no, that wasn’t it, was it? They hadn’t been in the wrong place. They had been exactly where they were meant to be.  

And then they had been murdered. 

"Lant," he said, voice deceptively casual, "exactly how much trouble do you think I’ll be in if I start digging?"  

Lant cackled, a high-pitched, obnoxiously gleeful sound. “Oh, Inspector,” he said. “I do hope you start digging.”  

“And why is that?”  

“Because I am dying to know what you’ll find.”

            







	***





                Lowe’s first instinct was to storm into Staffen’s office, shouting the odds, kicking down doors, and demanding someone start making sense of it all. But somehow—somehow—he managed to restrain himself. 

Lant’s use of that Silence Skill had meant that if anyone had been listening in to their conversation—and Lowe was beginning to suspect they very well might—then they hadn’t been able to hear a damn thing. He didn’t have many advantages right now, but no-one knowing what he knew might be the only one going for him.  

So instead of blowing the only card he had left, he went instead back to his office, shut the door, and slumped into his chair, staring out the grimy window at the Soar beyond.  

But the thing is, what did he actually know?  

Something important had been taken from the Vault. Something which was being kept there that was so important it had dragged the Black Knight—who had been dormant for over a year—back into play.

Lowe had checked. Almost from the moment of his Classtration, there had been no further crimes linked to the Black Knight. Not another murder. No more kidnappings. Nothing. It was like the laughter in that desolate warehouse had been the final act in a game no one else had really understood.

But now he was back. And his nemesis had, apparently, made off with something that had the Warden of the Reserve rattled. And not just the standard level of rattled that came with having a Vault full of dead people and a lot of cash vanish, but properly, ball-shakingly rattled. Morholt had basically been sweating blood through his expensive suit. And he’d tried to bribe a member of the Soar Security Services to give Soar Bank the head’s up on the investigation. That was the sort of thing that got people executed with extreme prejudice. And yet he’d been quite open about it.

And then there was Miss St Clair…

Thinking of her, Lowe activated Grid View.  

His memories flashed up in crisp detail—every recent meeting, every moment of his day, every interaction clear as day. And when he pulled up his conversation with Morholt, the vision played out exactly as he remembered.  

Morholt sat behind his ridiculously expensive desk, sweating through his collar, talking about those redacted files. Everything was exactly as it should be. Except for one thing. Miss St Clair wasn’t there.  

Or rather—there was a blurred, smudged distortion where she should have been. He rewound the memory and played it again. Nothing. Her voice was there. Her presence was there. But visually? It was as if something had reached into his own memory and smeared vaseline over the lens.  

The only time he’d ever experienced something similar was when he’d had to wade through necrotic slime. The presence of it had corroded Grid View, leaving gaps in his recall that he’d had to rebuild from written notes. But that wasn’t possible now. Mental Fortress negated that sort of effect. And the Shackled Grasp he was wearing should have reinforced that protection. Shouldn’t it?  

Lowe pushed away from his desk, opened his office door.  

“Kenny!” he called out.  

The receptionist, sitting at the centre of the bullpen, continued writing something down, ignoring him.  

“Kenny!”  

The man finally looked up. “Sorry, are you calling for me, sir?”  

“Yes, you. Kenny!”  

“My name’s Osbourne, sir.”  

“Is it? Are you sure?”  

Osbourne looked mildly bewildered. “Pretty sure, sir.”  

Lowe narrowed his eyes. “So, where’s Kenny? Out for lunch?”  

“I don’t know anyone of that name, sir.”  

One of the other Inspectors looked up from his paperwork.  “Do you mean Kenniel, sir? Tall guy, wore thick glasses?”  

“Yes,” Lowe said. “Kenny.”  

Osbourne and the other Inspector exchanged a glance. “They’ve not worked here for a while, sir,” the Receptionist said.  

Lowe felt a flush rise to his face. He really needed to start learning some new damn names around here. He coughed, covering his momentary lapse, and waved a hand. “Right. Osbourne. Thank you.”  

Osbourne nodded. “Sir?”  

“Can you bring me everything we have on a Miss St Clair who works over at Sovereign Bank HQ? She might, officially, be the Warden of the Reserves' PA, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s bollocks.”  

Osbourne’s eyes glazed slightly— obviously a Skill activating as he pulled up files from Cuckoo House’s records. His fingers twitched, indexing information, drawing reports from the archives.  “Would that be all, sir?” Osbourne asked, tone polite, but distant. “I would also be happy to make you a coffee.”  

Lowe waved him off. “No, just the files, thank you.”  

He sat back down at his desk and ran through the case again while he waited.

Something important had been stolen. The Black Knight had resurfaced after a year of silence. At least five military personnel—disguised as customers—had died in the Vault. Morholt was sweating bullets over something he wouldn’t name going missing. Miss St Clair had spoken to him, but left almost no trace in his own memory.  

And, most importantly, someone who had been pretending to be the Accountant, Elias Stern - who had actually committed all the murders - mentioned the Black Knight, and then killed himself.  

Lowe closed his eyes, replaying the memory of the Vault massacre in Grid View. Stern - or whoever had said they were Stern - had been traumatised. He had trembled when he’d spoken, his eyes darting like a trapped animal.  

But . . .

But . . .

Okay, Lowe thought. Let’s make some investigatory jumps. Say it wasn’t just a massive coincidence that the first five bodies Lant had tried to identify were military personnel. Say that, in reality, everyone in there had been. That, for reasons he didn’t quite understand, everyone who usually worked in the Vault had been . . . replaced by some heavy hitters. That ‘Elias Stern’ had been another one of these sealed record wankers. Stolen content warning: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.

So, whoever Lowe had spoken to—who had named the Black Knight before blowing their own head open—hadn’t been Stern at all.  

Which meant the real Elias Stern - and all the rest of the Vault workers were still out there somewhere - had been swapped out before the robbery. Maybe. Were the military there to protect something? Did someone know the Black Knight was back in play and had tried a little bait and switch to catch him?

“Fuck,” he said to no one in particular. “This is a shitshow.”

There was a knock at the door and he turned around in his chair, expecting to see Osbourne with the file he had requested. But no.

It wasn’t the Receptionist. It was his boss, Pernille Staffen.

And stood with her was someone Lowe had hoped never to see again.

It was the Mayor of Soar.  

***

The Mayor stepped into Lowe’s office like a man accustomed to owning space, his gait unhurried —not slow, not deliberate, but precisely calibrated to suggest confidence without effort. Control without force. Staffen followed behind him and closed the door, blacking out the windows with a push of mana.  

The years had been kind to him. Or, more likely, he was powerful enough to ensure that they had been. His hair was too dark to be its real colour, and was cut short and slicked down into place. Beneath it, his skin was unnervingly smooth - almost glassy - the effect of whatever expensive tinctures and alchemical concoctions were available to those at the very top of Soar’s food chain. Lowe had always been lairy of the sense of constructed perfection about him, like a painting commissioned by a man with no interest in realism, and that feeling had doubled - tripled - since the events of last year. 

The man was wearing archaic robes which were a deep burgundy trimmed with dark gold embroidery so fine it barely caught the light. Just like the subtle display of wealth Lowe had seen in Morholt’s office, this was deliberate restraint on show. This was power wrapped in the very best of taste. A man with nothing to prove because he had already won at the game of life.  

Yet, despite all that graceful elegance, there was still something in the way he held himself—something at the edges. Something just beneath the surface that Lowe had always disliked: even when the Mayor had been feteing him as ‘the future of Soar’s policing.’ A coiled sharpness, a tension that wasn’t nervous, but hunger. His smile was pleasant, easy, like a man greeting an old acquaintance, but his eyes never quite matched it. 

But that wasn’t the only thing that was strange, Lowe thought. Where were all his hangers-on? Where were the army of suits, the advisers, the assistants, the bodyguards? The men and women who usually formed the soft buffer between him and the rest of Soar? As far as Lowe knew, the Mayor never walked anywhere alone, and certainly never went anywhere unattended. And that was not out of fear - while not a powerhouse at Level 61, it would take quite some grunt to take him out - but rather because men like him were institutions in themselves. 

And institutions had hierarchies to maintain.  

And yet, here he was. In Cuckoo House. The Mayor of Soar in Lowe’s fucking office.

No guards.  

No witnesses.  

Just him.  

And Lowe had no bloody idea why.  

“Don’t stand there like a fucking hole-and-corner merchant, Lowe. Take a seat,” Staffen said, indicating for the Mayor also to do so and sitting herself once he had.

“If you don’t mind, boss, “ Lowe said, “I think I’ll remain standing. I’ve found it’s harder for people to fuck me over from this position.”

“Fuck’s sake, Lowe!” Staffen began, but the Mayor waved her into silence.

"No, no. Inspector Lowe is quite within his rights to assume nothing good is going to come of this little meeting. It is, after all, how the last time he was in my presence ended."

In my presence, Lowe thought. Fucking twat.

The Mayor placed his hands in his lap as if he were a patient teacher indulging a slow student and surveyed the room with the idle curiosity of a man who had never before had to sit in a space he did not own.

“This is all a little bare, Inspector,” he said, nodding towards Lowe’s desk. “I always pictured one of our brave Inspectors’ offices to be filled with papers, scattered case notes, perhaps an ashtray overflowing with the weight of sleepless nights. But this—this is almost ascetic.”

“Well, I’m not in the habit of leaving things lying around for just anyone to see,” Lowe replied. “Can’t imagine where such paranoia came from.”

“Sir!” Staffen said.

“It’s alright, boss. I don’t need you to call me that here. Just in private, you know.”

Lowe felt the buffet of a smorgasbord of mental Skills slam into him. Fuck knows what Staffen had just thrown at him for his impertinence, but the amount of Pressure he suddenly possessed was double that he’d had when St Clair had attacked him earlier in the day. For a moment of pure insanity, he considered firing it back at her. Then he remembered some of the stories he’d heard of her, and used it instead to refresh his Mana and Stamina. 

That made him feel better than he had in days.

He winked at her instead, which he sensed might have made things worse. The Mayor, though, gave every sign of having missed their interaction. “Paranoia?” The Mayor gave a pleasant laugh. “No, I think not. You have always seen patterns, Inspector Lowe, and were very good at recognising threats. A good quality to have in your line of work. Unfortunate, though, that such attributes also makes you very difficult to decide how to deal with.”

“That wasn’t too much of a problem last time, was it?”

“Ah, yes,” the Mayor said, as though discussing a minor inconvenience. “Your Classtration. That was all very unfortunate. But entirely necessary. Surely even you see that now? Your outstanding incompetence left the Council with no option. Heads needed to roll. And yours rolled so very well.”

Staffen frowned at that, but then reset her face into the same neutral expression. 

Lowe, however, didn’t think he needed to be especially politic if the guy was going to be a complete wanker about it. “Get to the fucking point. Sir.”

“Lowe,” Staffen growled, “for once in your life, can you try to at least pretend you’re not spoiling for a fight.”

“No, no, no, Penny. That’s exactly why I like him,” the Mayor interjected smoothly. “Inspector Lowe is—or was—an absolute force when pointed in the right direction. It was such a shame, really, that we had to cut that short. Thus, my delight has no bounds now that it appears he’s back to his fighting weight.” The Mayor looked above Lowe’s head, “Level 26? Impressive. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a Classless living more than a month. And then you cleared that nastiness with the High Priestess and took down Grackle Nuroon a peg or two. You really are becoming quite the man to watch.”

Lowe would have liked it if that last word hadn’t sounded quite so much like ‘murder horribly and scatter the ashes.”

“But let us not dwell on the past, shall we?” the Mayor continued. “I would like to talk about the present and, in particular, what has been recently stolen.”

“You mean from the Vault?” Lowe said. “Or do you mean what you took from me?”

“Clever.” The Mayor smiled. “You are so very clever with your little word games. But no, I am not here to discuss the Council’s decision around your Class. I would like to talk about what had been recently, and bloodily, removed from the Vault.”

“And why would that concern you, sir?”

The Mayor chuckled. “Because, Inspector, as I am sure you are starting to become aware, the Vault contained far more than money. More than jewels. It held a number of secrets. And, in Soar, secrets are much more valuable than gold.”

“And, what, you want me to find out who stole yours?”

“Oh, no, no, no. I was not so foolish as to entrust anything of mine to the dubious safety of the Vault. I am, though, extremely motivated to get my hands on what has been removed. Knowledge is power, and all that. What I need is for you to retrieve it. Quietly. Before things that should not be known are shared. It may be held that sunlight is the best disinfectant but, and I promise you this, the people of Soar are more than comfortable in their current crepuscular state. None of us need that situation . . . disturbed. At least, not until I have access to that information first.”

Well, at least this fucker was being honest.

“And if I say ‘no’?”

The Mayor’s smile didn’t waver. “Then, with the deepest of regret, I suppose we’ll have to see if there’s anything else of yours that I am able to take away from you.”

            







	***





                "Well, wasn't that a complete shitshow!" Staffen said, anger rolling off her in waves. And, where a Guardian of the Wall was concerned, this was entirely literal. Lowe's desk exploded, wood splinters scattering across the room, and the chair the Mayor had been sitting in liquified into a dark, smoldering puddle. 

Osbourne poked his head around the door and then quickly retreated when he caught her expression. Staffen slammed it shut behind him with enough force to rattle the frame and turned back to Lowe, her hands clenched into fists at her sides. 

"What the fuck have you got Cuckoo House mixed up into? The Warden of Reserves! The fucking Mayor!"

"Me! How is this possibly my fault? You called me to the Vault. You sent me into that fucking place. How didn’t you know there was a fucking military sting taking place?"

"Don't you take that tone with me, you wanker!"

"Have you seen the bodies, boss?" Lowe said, unwisely stepping towards her and then stepping back. He had absolutely no interest in discovering exactly how much heat his new manacle could withstand. The stories about Pernille Staffen’s anger back in the day were legendary. "There's a whole roomful of corpses down there with Penarth Lant. All with their heads fucking blown off through finding a joke far too fucking funny. So, don’t come at me about my tone!"

Staffen growled, a low, guttural sound, and the window behind Lowe blew out, shards of glass scattering across the floor. The air crackled with residual energy, the static pressing against his skin. For a moment, it looked like she was going to let loose again, but then she stopped, clamping her jaw shut and taking a long, measured breath through her nose. 

She exhaled, flexing her fingers like she was forcing herself to let go of the rage. "Come on," she said, turning abruptly and yanking open the office door.

"Come where?" Lowe asked, falling into step behind her.

"I need a fucking drink."

As she went, she shot a glare at Osbourne, who was still hovering outside, looking like he very much wanted to be anywhere else. "Make sure Lowe’s office is back in one piece by the time we get back."

Osbourne nodded quickly, already halfway out the door to find someone else to delegate the mess to. 

Lowe sighed. It wasn’t just Staffen’s temper that was reported to be legendary. This was going to be one hell of a night.

***

“No, Jana. I am not giving you a . . . sorry, what was it you asked for?”

“The-Mother-of-all-Hangover-Cures. Come on, Mylaf, I’m dying over here!”

Mylaf folded her arms and gave him a look so dry it could have absorbed the entire bar spill from the night before. “Well, as my mother always told me,” the Drudge said, “people who live in glasshouses shouldn’t drink their body weight in alcohol with their boss.”

Lowe groaned, draping himself dramatically across the kitchen table. “I told you, it was a tactical decision. Like a strategic bonding exercise. She was angry with me, the least I could do was share a few drinks with her. You wouldn’t understand. You lack the necessary male frailty.”

“Oh, forgive me,” Mylaf said, deadpan. “I didn’t realise projectile vomiting was part of leadership development.”

Lowe cracked an eye open. “Am I hearing this is as a ‘no’ on the cure?”

“Not necessarily. I’m still considering it.”

“Great, while you’re at it, could you also consider never letting me drink ever again?” Lowe said. “I think my liver’s writing its resignation letter.”

“Forgive me, but don’t you have some sort of stupidly overpowered heal Skill, sir? Surely you shouldn’t be feeling this unwell?”

Lowe dry heaved. Whatever Staffen and he had been drinking last night, Roll with the Punches wasn’t willing to go anywhere near it. Considering the latest version of that Skill could bring him back from the fucking dead, it suggested his boss’ favourite drinking establishment had quite the cocktail menu.

“Please, Mylaf!”

The Drudge sighed, rolling her eyes with the long-suffering patience of someone forced to babysit an overgrown child. Which, Lowe thought, was kind of her life now. With a resigned flick of her wrist, she produced a steaming, bubbling glass beaker from her inventory, the liquid inside shifting colours like it couldn’t quite decide whether to be alarming or outright fatal. 

Lowe’s kitchen lights flickered ominously. Somewhere in the distance, a thunderclap rumbled. 

“This really isn’t something I want to make a habit of, sir,” Mylaf said, lifting the beaker high as if presenting it to the gods themselves. “The Mistress had the occasional habit of drinking too much on Gravalk’s Day of Flame and I always found making this for her the following day to be . . . distasteful.”

“It looks like something that should come with an emergency contact form.”

“Oh, it does, sir,” Mylaf said produced a scroll and slapping it onto the table. “Sign here, here, and here to waive liability, and here to promise you won’t come haunting me if this accidentally bestows eldritch enlightenment.”

“I’m sensing this is a ‘bit’, Mylaf and I’m really not in the mood. If you wouldn’t mind, could I have it, please?”

Mylaf smiled and swirled the liquid as a faint, high-pitched giggle emanated from the beaker itself. The drink was laughing at him. “Bottoms up,” she said, handing it over with all the gravity of a mad scientist bestowing forbidden knowledge upon an unworthy apprentice.

Lowe downed it in one and almost immediately felt one hundred percent better. And then he very much didn’t.

At all.

“Oh yes,” Mylaf said, as he pushed past her in the rush for the bathroom, “I should have mentioned. It might be best if you thought of this as less of a hangover cure and more a very, very powerful emetic.”

***

Half a - very unpleasant - bell later, Lowe was showered, shaved and feeling a little bit more like himself. Whilst he’d been . . . emptying out all sorts of undesirable compounds from his body, Mylaf had been working through the list of names he’d left her to contact, and there was quite a collection of beings awaiting him in his living room when he was finally ready.

“I’m just going to come right out and say it,” Hel said, “I don’t think the whole ‘inviting people around to hear me vomit’ thing is likely to catch on as a social experiment.”

“No,” Karolen agreed. “And while we’re on things that it would be great for you not to do again, can we add having all our Sending Stones buzzed with a ‘Help, I’m really in the shit!’ message. Some of us have bosses that aren’t great fans of us taking personal days. Or, specifically, of you.”This story originates from a different website. Ensure the author gets the support they deserve by reading it there.

“I can very much recommend self-employment, Auditor Mehan. Definitely beats toiling for the man,” Rook said. “Although, full disclosure, I probably wouldn’t recommend having your heart ripped out to achieve it. There’s probably a happy medium to be found.”

“Good point, well made, creepy new person. Thanks for that,” Latham said. “But I’m going to agree with the Auditor, little man. This better be good. Some of us are actually, you know, crucial to the smooth running of Soar.”

“On that note,” Ortel said, “I feel I should say again that I am not really sure what I’m doing here amongst such illustrious company.”  The one-armed Druid blushed as he spoke and then refreshed the three Totems of Silence Lowe had insisted were in place before any of them spoke.

“You’re here, Counsel Maybourne because you’re the only person who works in the Tower of Law who I think I can trust right now -” Arebella significantly cleared her throat - “at least, the only person I’m not sleeping with,” Lowe finished lamely.

“Well, if everyone has their refreshments, I think I’ll retire to my room,” Mylaf said, standing.

“Actually, if you don’t mind, Mylaf, I think I would rather you stayed. We might need some words of advice.” The Drudge smiled at Lowe’s words and sat back down again.

“Okay,” Lowe said. “If we’re all settled, I’ll make a start. As I think my message made clear, I think I might be somewhat in the shit . . .”

It took less time than he had anticipated to outline the current situation. For something that had taken on a somewhat colossal size in his own mind, talking it through in this setting actually helped him start to get things into order.

“So, to summarise,” Latham said after Lowe had finished. “The Black Knight is apparently back. He’s taken something lots of people want, and you’ve been given rather uncomplicated orders by the Mayor to get it back.”

“On the other hand, the Warden of the Reserves is openly willing to bribe you to ensure he gets first dibs on whatever was nicked. And he’s got some sort of scary bitch at his back, urging him on.” Karolen said.

“And not forgetting that there’s military involvement,” Hel said. “Probably an Out of Bounds squad which, for those at the back, are absolutely not allowed to operate on Soar soil.”

“Oh, and there are a whole bunch of people who apparently have gone missing, which no one seems to care about,” Mylaf completed with a frown. “Don’t forget them.”

“Yeah, that sounds about the size of it,” Lowe said. “So, I guess my question to you all is, ‘how screwed am I?’”

“Well, very, obviously,” Ortel said, then realised everyone was looking at him. “I mean… well, yes. I think that’s what I mean. Very screwed.” Ortel shifted in his chair like a man who had accidentally wandered into a den of starving lions and just noticed he was carrying a slab of raw meat. Then he adjusted his spectacles, refreshed the Totem of Silence and licked his lips. But didn’t say anything.

“Please, mate,” Lowe said, “this is why I asked for you to join us here. I need to understand my legal jeopardy.”

Ortel closed his eyes for a moment and took a breath, when he opened them again, his nervous energy hadn’t vanished, exactly, but it tightened, became something purposeful. Lowe remembered this guy standing up like a baller in the Celestial Temple when all that shit with Cenorth went down. He wasn’t as silly as his appearance suggested. 

“Okay. Let me break this down for you.” He tapped his fingers against the table. “First and foremost, as a sworn officer of the Soar Security Services, you—Inspector Lowe—are legally and contractually obligated to ensure the return of any stolen property from the Vaults of Soar. It does not matter whether or not it’s a job you want. The law is clear on this matter: anything stolen from the Vault is a matter of state security, and as a member of the Security Services, you are bound by law to ensure its recovery.”  

“Yeah, Staffen was pretty heavy on that one last night.”  

“Oh, I am afraid it gets worse than that,” Ortel said. “Because, as you are no doubt aware, bribery - both offering and accepting - is a felony. That means you cannot accept any offer from the Warden of the Reserves in exchange for preferential treatment in this investigation. If you were to do so—if, say, you were to quietly pass along any information to Soar Bank in return for a financial or professional favor—you would be in violation of statutes regarding corrupt practices in law enforcement. And that, Lowe, would earn you an execution, faster than you can say ‘gross misconduct.’ That it appears he is willing to back up the bribery offer with manifest threat to your wellbeing should you not comply is neither here nor there. You cannot treat with the Warden of the Reserves, regardless of any threatened consequences.”  

“Fantastic.”  

“Unfortunately, though, I’m still not finished. Because while you also cannot enter into any sort of private arrangement with the Mayor, of the two men, the Mayor or the Warden, that have offered you some sort of quid pro quo, it is actually the Mayor’s interference which is worse for you. Legally speaking.”  

“How?” Lowe said. “Surely doing what the Mayor asks isn’t illegal?”  

“I am afraid it is not as simple as that,” Ortel said. “The Mayor recently had a law forced through by the Council - Section 14 of the Executive Oversight Act, if anyone is interested -which states that any municipal official found to be complicit in a criminal conspiracy is subject to immediate legal recourse, regardless of their position.”  

Lowe blinked. “Come again?”  

“It was meant as a power move against certain—shall we say—troublesome trade guilds. But the wording is dangerously broad. In this situation, what it means is that if you enter into a personal arrangement with the Mayor - beyond the scope of your position as a member of the Security Services - and that arrangement is found to interfere with a state-mandated investigation, then you - not the Mayor - would be in violation of Section 14, which means you would be legally stripped of your rank, your authority, and detained for obstruction of justice.”  

Rook let out a low whistle. “So, in short: he can’t pick up what the Warden is putting down, he definitely can’t make any sort of personal deal with the Mayor, and he’s legally responsible for returning whatever was stolen in any event.”  

“Yes,” Ortel said simply.  

“You need to tell him that it’s actually worse,” Hel said. “About the military?”

“Oh, yes, indeed. It is very much. Much, much worse,” Ortel said. “Because that brings us to the possible involvement of Out of Bounds squads” Ortel steepled his fingers. “Out of Bounds units cannot be sanctioned to operate in Soar. Not by anyone. Not even the Mayor. Of course, we all know that they do. But the legal framework that allows them to function is… let’s call it ‘deliberately vague.’ The one thing that is clear, however, is that they do not answer to local law enforcement. They answer to higher authorities.”  

“And if I need to work with them to catch the Black Knight?” Lowe asked.  

“Then you will be committing treason. And that is even if the Mayor tells you to.”  

“Treason?” Latham said. “Bit harsh, isn’t it?”  

“Not in the eyes of the law,” Ortel said, shaking his head. “The moment Lowe knowingly assists an Out of Bounds unit in Soar, he is operating outside of his jurisdiction as a member of the Security Services and directly undermining civil authority. That makes him—by any definition—a rogue operative. And rogue operatives, under current law, are to be treated as enemy assets.”  

“By doing what the Mayor is ordering me to do, I’ll become an enemy asset?” Lowe repeated. “That sounds pretty much par for the course at this stage.”

“Yes,” Ortel confirmed. “If you knowingly assist an Out of Bounds unit on Soar soil, you’ll not just be fired. You’’ll be . . well, they can’t Classtrate you again. But I’m sure they’ll find something suitably unpleasant.”  

Karolen let out a slow breath. “Well. Isn’t all this very cheerful? It’s making me positively homesick for Soar Museam.”  

“So, just so I’m clear. I have to recover whatever was stolen from the Vault, but I can’t work with the Warden of Reserves because of bribery laws. I can’t cut a deal with the Mayor because of his own legislation. And I can’t cooperate with an Out of Bounds operation that’s had a bunch of its members slaughtered because that would make me a fucking traitor.”  

Ortel nodded. “That about covers it.”  

“Brilliant,” Lowe said. “So what, pray tell, do you suggest I do?”  

Ortel hesitated. “Officially?”  

“Yes, Ortel, officially.”  

“Well, officially, I would suggest you solve this case without breaking any laws.”  

“Fantastic.”  

Rook coughed. “Well, I, for one, have full faith in you there, buddy.”  

“Okay. Well, thanks for that, Ortel. Cheery stuff. So, I’m throwing it open to the floor. Everyone here’s a certifiable monster in their own right. Looking for ideas.”

Latham was the first to speak. “Look, this is all cart before the horse, isn’t it? You don’t even know what it is you’re supposed to be looking for. As far as I can see, you’re borrowing trouble. It doesn’t matter what the Warden, or the Mayor or a fucking Out of Bounds squad wants from you. It’s going to be the same thing, isn’t it? You need to take the fucking Black Knight down. Everything else is fucking noise until we do that.”

“We?” Lowe said.

“Well, I presume you didn’t gather us all here to hold hands and sing kumbaya. We’re your guys, right? Ride or die.”

“Can I just check,” Ortel said. “How committed do we all have to be to the second option?”

            







	***





                After leaving Lowe’s flat, Hel didn’t change pace as she moved back onto the corner of Devastation and Contemplation, keeping her steps even, her posture relaxed. The tail was good. Not exceptional. But good. They hadn’t done anything as stupid as staring directly at her or mirroring her movements, and they were keeping just the right amount of distance - blending into the morning foot traffic and sticking to the kind of casual, forgettable pace that made them difficult to pick out of the crowd.

She might not have even clocked them if the habit of checking hadn’t been beaten into her decades before. She was certain there hadn’t been anyone there when Latham and she had made their way to Lowe’s apartment. So her sudden shadow meant someone had put professionals on Lowe.  

Which meant Lowe was exactly as deep in the shit as he suspected.  

Without breaking stride, she took Latham’s hand as they strolled past a street vendor hawking fried dough and squeezed his fingers three times. Their code. It had started as a joke—something she’d taught him after a run-in with a particularly nasty pickpocket gang a few weeks back. One squeeze: Something’s off. Two squeezes: Eyes on me. Three squeezes: We have a problem.  

Latham squeezed back. A question. We fucking?  

She assumed he meant We fucking shit up? but it was sometimes hard to tell with him.  

Hel stopped, turned him towards her, and pulled him into a kiss, slow and deep, tilting her head just enough to whisper against his lips.  

“No,” she murmured. “I got this. You head back to work. Can’t have keep the gods waiting”  

Latham didn’t argue. He kissed her back, all heat and promise, but there was no hesitation in the way he stepped away. No lingering glance. No unnecessary bravado. That was what she liked about him. No posturing, no puffed-up are you sure, babe? nonsense. No insistence on taking the lead when she’d indicated she had things in hand.  

Most of her past lovers had been, at least in theory, into the idea of a strong, independent woman. But in practice? The moment they saw exactly what that meant—when they saw her duck a blade, snap a man’s wrist, or pick a mark out of a crowd—they balked.  

Latham didn’t.  

He had self-confidence to spare, and apparently, not a single worry in the world about his lady handling her own business.  He shot her a wink and peeled off toward the Celestial Temple, leaving her to it.  

Hel cracked her neck, rolled her shoulders, and took a sharp right into an alley and had just enough time to register the man moving before he was on her. Apparently, it wasn’t just following her that was on today’s dance card.

There was no hesitation. No circling. No attempt at conversation or gauging her skill. Just a knife in his hand and a sharp, downward arc aimed straight at her ribs. 

Ballsy.

Also thick as pig shit.  

Hel twisted aside, one foot sliding back as the blade skimmed past her jacket, and sent three Wind Blades flying before she even had chance to properly think about it.  

Too fast. Too many.  

The first caught him at the shoulder, the second at the thigh. The third sliced clean across his neck.  

Hel landed lightly, watching as the man’s momentum carried him forward another two steps before his body caught up to the fact that it had just been bisected. He collapsed to the cobbles in two pieces, a widening pool of blood seeping into the street.  

Yeah, that had been too much. She hadn’t meant to liquefy the poor bastard, but she still wasn’t quite used to the power surge that had come with passing Level 50. Sloppy. Interrogation 101. Dead mean didn’t tell you who sent them  

Then a slight chill ran up the back of her neck.  

Not from looking at the body.  

Not from all the blood.  

She wasn’t alone.

Once more, Hel was reacting before her conscious mind got involved - ducking, pivoting, twisting - just in time for some sort of insanely OP energy bolt to graze the spot where her throat had been a second earlier. The sonic boom briefly disoriented her, so she barely got a look at the second attacker before she was there, pressing her advantage.  

She was blonde - tall and athletic - and fought with the kind of fluidity Hel had only ever seen in really high-level killers. Every attack was delivered without any wasted movement, and every block was instinctive as if she was running through an ingrained, well-grooved sequence.  

Hel grinned.  

This one was going to be fun.  

***

Arebella had been only half-listening to Karolen and Ortel as they walked back to the Tower of Law, her mind still turning over the tangled mess of legal, political, and practical impossibilities Lowe had announced back in his flat. 

Her heart went out to him. Not only was the Black Knight apparently back, but the whole situation stank. It was just like it was before. Too many conflicting interests. Too many people playing their own games with Lowe as a pawn. It was a wonder he wasn’t already buried in a shallow grave somewhere.  

She turned to ask Ortel a question, when something in the corner of her vision glowed gold. It was only a flicker. But that was all it needed to be.

Arebella’s steps slowed, one of her Skills kicking in hard, honing in on an inconsistency in what she was looking at. A lie. And a big one. But where?

Her head turned, eyes narrowing on the side alley they were just about to pass. There was a pile of discarded crates lying near the entrance. Next to them was a slumped figure in a cloak. Ordinary. Forgettable. But the glow coiled around the space, clinging to the edges of the crates and the fallen person like light catching the sheen of an oil slick.  

That wasn’t right.

She stopped, grabbing hold of Karolen’s arm. “Wait!”  

“What?” Karolen said.

Arebella didn’t answer. She took a half-step back, pulling the Auditor with her. Something about this felt extremely wrong. Her Skill more usually worked when it was people telling lies. But she supposed it could happen if things weren’t quite as they seemed . . .The author's content has been appropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.

And then the trap snapped shut. The crates exploded outward, shattering as figures burst from cover. Moving very fast. And they were armed. 

Fortunately, Karolen didn’t hesitate. Her Balanceblade formed in her hand, and her weight shifted so that she could cover the other two. For a moment, she thought it might have been an elaborate mugging - maybe an ill-advised attempt at XP gathering? -  but once the first attacker she tried to bisect blinked through her attack and kicked her in the back, she re-evaluated. These weren’t street thugs, they were professionals.  

Arebella, for her part, dodged to the side as something whipped toward her—a binding hex, one of them had thrown out—her feet barely cleared the arc of it before it could lock around her limbs. Sigh. Another one of Lowe’s advisories that wanted to take her captive. This shit was getting old. However, with absolutely no offensive skills, her best weapon was going to be avoidance. 

Karolen, on the other hand, didn’t have that problem.  

There was a reason even someone as gnarly as Grackle Naroon hadn’t want to tangle with an Auditor. 

Her Forensic Dissection Skill activated the moment she engaged, the world sharpening as combat data flooded into her mind. Five assailants. Levels 30, which wasn’t ideal, but she’d faced much worst. They were all armed with standard-issue mono-filament daggers and whatever Class they had, which was hidden from her, had minimal defensive Skills. Better than hired goons, but not much. 

Her Balanceblade lashed out, the first slash disrupting the nearest attacker’s mana flow, crippling their movement speed. A quick side step, and she drove the sword into a weak spot, severing all sorts of tendons.

One very down.  

Then she was already pivoting, redirecting a second attack. And a third. There were too many of them and they were coming too fast. More than she could reasonably handle alone. A fist collided with her ribs, the impact jarring even through her Auditor armor, she headbutted the attacker and drove a knee into his midsection. In the corner of her eye she saw Arebella duck another Skill-based binding attempt, falling out of reach of the woman reaching for her, but trying to track all of what was happening at once was too much.  

Karolen might be holding her own, but not for much longer.

And where the fuck was Ortel?

Arebella risked a quick look behind her.

Despite everything going on around them, the Druid was stood utterly still, his one hand raised, fingers moving through intricate gestures. His other arm pressed against his chest, his breathing slow. Then, with sudden, effortless violence, the ground beneath them changed.

A totem flared to life at Ortel’s feet—not one, but three—overlapping sigils of Earthen Strength, Natural Force, and something Karolen couldn’t identify.  

And the world around them reacted.  

The cobblestones shifted, turning to grasping roots, thick vines snapping upward, ensnaring the attackers before they could react. Those they caught were dragged down to the floor.  At the same time, the air thickened, pressing in on those the roots missed, slowing their movements further and turning their every action into something more sluggish and strained.  

Then came the final touch.  

Lightning crashed down from clear skies. A single, shuddering bolt slammed directly into the last standing enemy, sending them convulsing to the ground in a heap of crackling, smoking flesh.  

Silence.  

For a long moment, no one moved.  

Karolen moved her Balanceblade back into her inventory and turned to Ortel, raising her eyebrows at the unexpected destruction.

“What can I say, Auditor Mehan? I didn’t always want to be a lawyer.”

***

Rook was surprised anyone was bothering to follow him. 

He'd felt the presence of those that peeled off to go after the others after they'd left Lowe's apartment. He'd wondered if he was supposed to warn them about that? He'd been finding that sort of decision much harder since he'd been . . . what, resurrected? He wasn't sure that was the right word. Prevented from passing? That might be more like it. 

In any event, he couldn't seem to work out whether he should tell everyone that there were little groups following them all home. He didn’t seem to know those sorts of things anymore.  

But then it was too late, and everyone had gone their separate ways. 

He didn't think it had ended up mattering, though. Not if the visions he had of a number of violent deaths were anything to go by. Good on the lawyer. He was surprised the tubby little Druid had it in him.

Rook didn’t change pace as he stepped into the tree line, his boots crunching through piles of fallen leaves. Soar’s glow was already fading behind him, replaced by the cool hush of the deep woods, shadows pooling between skeletal branches.

He didn’t need to turn around to know he was being followed.  

Once upon a time, he thought he would have been able to evaluate them. Know what he was dealing with. But he didn’t seem to have that skill any more. These guys probably were. But, then again, he’d been aware of them since he’d left Lowe’s flat. So how good could they really be?

Mind you, a year of looking at the world through other eyes meant he had a pretty good sense of when something was hunting him.  

So what’s the play here, he wondered. Ambush? No. If they wanted him dead, they’d have just done him in the streets. They would, wouldn’t they? That’s certainly what he would have done. Following a target of unknown strength into the dark woods? That wasn’t a smart play. Or was it? He supposed they’d find out - one way or another.

The trees thickened as Rook moved deeper, the path narrowing into a ribbon of twisting roots and whispering underbrush. He heard those behind him adjust, closing in just slightly now that he’d led them out of sight of the streets. Two at the back. One to his left, keeping parallel. A fourth somewhere ahead, waiting.  

Oh. He saw what they were doing. They thought they were boxing him in.  

Bless their souls.

His footsteps slowed and he made out the sound of a branch snapping somewhere behind him. Rook thought it was probably time to cause an end to all this. He stopped walking entirely and loosened his shoulders slightly. “Are you lot going to introduce yourselves, or am I meant to guess?”  

No response.  

“Fine. We’ll do it your way.”  

He shrugged off his coat, he didn’t want that getting dirty, and let it drop to the ground in a pool of dark fabric.  

Then he moved. Clearly faster than any of them could have possibly expected. One moment, he was standing, and the next, he had crossed the distance between himself and the nearest man, his fingers slamming into soft flesh as he drove a hand into the bastard’s gut and out the back.  

A choked gasp, and Rook pulled his arm back, letting the body sink to the floor beneath him.

The second one came at him immediately, faster reflexes than the first. Good. It would almost be insulting if they weren’t. Knife. Reverse grip. Close-quarters discipline. Classy.   

Rook caught the wrist before the blade could sink in, turning the momentum against him, spinning him sideways and slamming a knee into his chest. The man grunted but didn’t go down, twisting, moving to disengage. Rook simply let him go and crushed his windpipe with the heel of his palm instead.  

Rook’s head snapped towards the third figure. A woman with a crossbow. A good one. Military grade. Already aimed.  

He moved before the trigger was pulled, twisting with unnatural speed, the bolt whipping past his shoulder as he closed the gap in the time it took to exhale. The woman wasn’t fast enough to reload.  

Rook was.  

His fingers caught her by the throat, lifting her off the ground, holding her there just long enough to feel her struggle. Just long enough to let the realisation set in. And then he squeezed. 

Rook turned to the last man.  

The one who had been waiting. The leader. Unlike the others, he hadn’t moved.  

He was watching. Assessing. 

Smart. 

Rook wiped the blood from his knuckles and took a slow step forward.  

The leader didn’t move. He just tilted his head slightly as if reconsidering something. Yeah, that was the wrong time for that.

Rook smiled, wide and wolfish. “You thought you had me. That’s adorable.” The leader’s shoulders tensed. Rook took another step. “You thought you were hunting me.” Another step. “But I don’t think you understand.”  

And then, suddenly, Rook’s eyes were different. Something dark shifted behind them, something old, something not entirely sane. His voice lowered, something almost gentle in it now. “I’ve already had experience of being hunted.” The leader took an instinctive step back as Rook’s grin widened even further. “And I really didn’t care for it.”

            







	***





                It was quiet.  

For the first time in what felt like days, Lowe was actually alone in his flat. The murmur of conversation, the clink of cups against saucers, the weight of far too many problems pressing down upon too few shoulders…

Well, for now, all of it was gone. He’d given each of his friends something to run with - something he hoped they would be able to get done without drawing too much heat. 

He knew each and every one of them was more than capable of looking after themselves, but, well, he’d spent the last year as a lone wolf, precisely because - after what had happened - he had promised never to be the cause of putting people in harm’s way again. It felt pretty shitty that, the moment the Black Knight was back, he’d defaulted to the same old cavalier Lowe. Using people he was supposed to care about to help shovel him out of the shit.

That they all seemed entirely happy to pitch in made it no less stressful. The last team he’d worked with had been pretty happy to get involved too . . .

Mylaf had made him a cup of hot chocolate before she’d vanished to her room, as if she’d known he’d need something to keep his spirits up. He took a sip, and— 

[You Have Consumed 'Soothing Chocolate of Calm.']  

Effects: Warm Fuzzy Feeling (+40% Relaxation). Heartbeat of the Hearth (+10% Emotional Resilience). Blissful Composure (Immune to Stress Effects for 1 hour).

Yeah. That would do it. Even as his mood began to shift to something more, if not content, then not as hyperventilating panicked, Lowe physically felt his shoulders slump as the tension drained out of them. As he, almost against his will, began to relax, he felt his mind drift away from the present, his awareness - Grid View bleeding open and across into his conscious mind - stretching backward. Backward—  

And suddenly, he was in an older version of this room. He instinctively knew it was from about eighteen months ago. From after the third - or was it the fourth - murder? 

The table he was sat at back then was even more cluttered, strewn with reports, coffee cups, and a half-eaten bag of fried dough sticks that had somehow become a permanent fixture in their department’s diet. What they would have done to have had access to Mylaf and her non-stop boosting snacks back then! The single enchanted light above them flickered on and off as the worn-out rune - he still hadn’t got around to changing it, had he? - struggled to keep up with yet another unofficial overtime shift.  

Rook was sitting opposite Lowe, face in what, of late, had become its perpetual frown. To his right, Arman—broad as a bear, with forearms like tree trunks—was leaning back in his chair, balancing it on two legs with an impressive disregard for gravity. Coda had his boots up on the table, flipping through a mound of witness statements, while Faulks—always the most focused of them—was twirling a pen between her fingers as she absentmindedly added notes to the crime scene sketches spread out all around them.  

And all of them—all of them—had their eyes on Lowe.  

"For fuck’s sake!" Arman said, wobbling alarmingly on his chair. "We need some cards on the table here, boss. You’ve got to share with us what you’re thinking about all this. You know we’ll be with you whatever way you want to play it, but it’s shitty the way you’re keeping us all in the dark."  

"What makes you believe I’m thinking anything? I might be just as stumped as the rest of you."  

"Because,” Faulks said, scribbling something out and drawing a few chest pieces in the margins, “you’re always two steps ahead of what you tell the rest of us. And it's fucking annoying."  

"Seriously, Jana," Coda said, swinging his feet to the floor and tossing his files back onto the pile. "You’ve had us running in circles for weeks now. We’ve got to change it up! We keep almost getting close to this bastard, and then he still manages to slip away. Every single time. You keep saying you’re right on the precipice of working something out, and yet, shockingly, none of us have seen it."  

"Look, it's not that I don't trust you—"  

"Don’t fucking kid a kidder," Arman said. "It’s obvious you don't! We all know you’ve been checking into our financials. You’ve not even been subtle about it. What? Do you think one of us is tipping the Black Knight off? Because, newsflash, there’s nothing to tell. We’ve got nothing. I haven’t even been able to leak anything juicy to the press, and you know how I like doing that."  

Rook lifted a placating hand. "Arman, cool it. It’s me that’s being looking into us all. And that’s just good sense, isn’t it? Don’t you want to know we’re all on the level? That we’re not taking backhanders? And trust me, considering the body count this fucker is racking up, the saddest thing I’ve had to do this week is trawl through everyone’s porn and booze expenses. You should all be very much ashamed. What Lowe means," he said, "is that the boss doesn't want to show his full hand until he's sure it's the right one to play. And—" He shot Lowe a knowing look. "—he also doesn't want Cenorth jumping in and booting us off the case when it becomes clear how little, in reality, we have. No one here wants to be taken off this, do they?"  

That earned a round of murmured agreement.  

They all knew the Commander in Cuckoo House was as much a political animal as he was an officer. And it was no secret that he’d let Lowe run with this case for far longer than any of them expected, especially considering how few proper leads they had. There’d already been more deaths than could be conveniently dismissed as just the way things are in Soar. They all suspected that it wouldn’t be long before the Celestial Temple would be getting involved, and then the case would be pried from their fingers faster than they could blink. 

None of them wanted that to happen. Lowe, especially, didn’t want to be pulled off this case. Which, yes, meant he was keeping the very few cards he had managed to scare up close to his chest.  Reading on this site? This novel is published elsewhere. Support the author by seeking out the original.

"Look," he said. "I’m sorry if anyone thinks I’m being a dick about things. But, I promise, I do think we’re closing in on him. However, if we’re not careful, the Mayor will toss this to the Temple Warders, and we all know we’ll be sidelined. And I don’t know about you lot, but I am not watching a bunch of shiny god-arse kissing bastards come in and snatch the case out from under us just as we’re about to get a break in things."  

"No argument from me on that score, boss,’ Faulks said. “But Cenorth’s going to pull the plug soon if we don’t show some progress. The Mayor’s had a higher tolerance for dead aristocrats than I think any of us expected, but there’s got to be a hard limit to how many of his mates he’s willing to never see again."  

"Fuck that,” Arman huffed. “Cenorth’s all bluster. Lowe’s got him properly wrapped around his finger. It won’t be him that tosses the case elsewhere. As far as the Commander is concerned, Lowe’s shit don’t stink."  

Lowe rolled his eyes at that. He was getting bored of the Golden Boy bullshit. "If that were true, this case wouldn’t have nearly gotten me strangled by one of his assets in a back alley last week."  

"Yeah, about that. We’ve all had a chat, and we agree that was your fault," Faulks said.  

"Is it my fault that an informant wanted to kill me?"  

"Yes," the group said in unison.  

Rook chuckled, shaking his head. "Alright, alright, enough bullying of poor Inspector Low. Back to the actual case—where do we stand? Let’s go around the table. Faulks? What do you have?"  

The dark-haired woman leaned forward, resting her elbows on Lowe’s table and disturbing one of the piles of dirty dishes. Arman caught each of them before they hit the dirt, moving ridiculously quickly. One of the benefits of a Speed-based Class "Sorry!” Faulks said. “Look, we know the Black Knight appears to act within a tight pattern and a regulated time-scale. It turns out he’s been targeting high-profile figures for months, but it took us a while to catch on. No harm, no foul. Unless you happened to be especially attached to rich wankers. However, we can see that there’s been nothing random about when he acts. We’re expecting his next performance in forty-eight bells, but we have no idea who will be the target. There has to be some connection between them all."  

Coda stretched, tossing a small stone in the air and catching it repeatedly. "I still say we just stake out all the guys and gals we’ve got flagged as the next likely targets and wait for him to show up. Then we kick his teeth in and call it a day."  

"Great plan," Arman deadpanned. "Nuanced. Very much within our wheelhouse."  

"Yeah?” Coda said. “Well, I save nuanced is for people with time to waste. We lose this case to the Temple and we’ll never hear the end of it."  

Faulks tapped a finger against the case files, nearly knocking them over again. She really was the clumsiest person in the whole of Soar, Lowe thought. "Look, we’ve come this far, we’re nearly there. We know his methods. We know he loves to leave messages. Cryptic shite. Like he wants us to figure something out."  

"Like he’s playing a game," Rook said.

"Or testing us," Lowe added.  

"Well, we are very testable," Arman said.  

There was laughter, but it was strained. They were all running on fumes, and they all knew it. There had to be something they were missing. A puzzle piece that hadn’t clicked into place. 

Lowe knew that they’d talk for another few bells before dispersing. It would be the following morning that Rook would come to him with his epiphany about the next . . . event being a kidnapping. He’d cross-referenced all of the weird clues that had been left at the murder scene and thought he’d made sense of them. Of course, it didn’t help them overly much as they still had no idea who the target was going to be, but it had been a moonshot of a development on the case.

Then, just as that memory began to fade, Coda said something.

Something small.

Something insignificant.

But—

"Wait!"

Lowe’s mind snapped back to the present. He was back alone in his flat, with the warmth from the hot chocolate still lingering in his bones. However, his heartbeat was racing as if he’d just run a marathon. He tried to slow his breathing as he forced himself to replay the memory, dragging his focus back to that exact moment.

Coda.

He’d been smiling, tossing that stupid little stone in the air. Lowe and Rook had been deep in discussion, and Arman was just bending down to catch something else Faulks had inadvertently knocked off the table. No one was really listening to him as he chatted.

"I mean, if you think about it," he'd said, "he’s obviously a psycho, but the Black Knight’s got style, you’ve got to give him that. All those little personal touches at the crime scene? The way he signs off in a way that is totally appropriate to the slaying? I tell you, he’s got a real eye for theatre. Remember the use of the enchanted red rope at the third scene? Fitting, right? Proper storybook villain shit."

Lowe didn’t think he’d heard him at the time, Coda chatted so much shit it was easy for him to just become background noise—especially as yes, the bastard did have a sense of theatre, and yes, everything about his crimes had been deliberately performative. But—

But.

Red rope?

That method by which the corpse of Marin Sahult had been suspended from his chandelier had been shocking, for sure. They’d had to wake a local Warlock to come and dispel whatever fucking Skill the Black Knight had used. But Coda hadn’t been on shift that night, had he? And, seeking to have something that wasn’t immediately public knowledge about the murder scenes, Lowe had deliberately withheld that detail from his report.

Of course, he tried to reason, there had to be a million ways Coda might have picked the detail up.

But. But. But.

At the time, he’d just been distracted. Too focused on tracking patterns, on fighting with Cenorth, on keeping the case away from the Celestial Temple to properly pay attention. But now, sitting here in his quiet flat, feeling the last traces of Mylaf’s hot chocolate humming through his system—

The description of the enchanted rope had been sealed behind every security clearance Cuckoo House had. There really was no way Coda should have known it was red.

No way.

How the fuck had he known?

Lowe’s fist clenched against the table.

The memory was slipping away again, details scattering like leaves on the wind, but that single line—those words—hung in his mind like a lead weight.

What the fuck did I miss there? Lowe thought. Why was this memory coming back now?

What was he supposed to be seeing? He was still struggling with it when his Sending Stone buzzed. He jolted at the sudden vibration, the sound cutting through the thick haze of thought. Lowe swiped it up, glancing at the glowing runes.

Hel.

He clicked the connection open, pressing it to his ear.

"My place," she said.

A pause.

"Now."

            







	***





                "Were you followed?"

Lowe barely had time to blink before Hel had grabbed him by the arm and yanked him inside. He wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting, but this definitely wasn’t it. For starters, he’d never actually been inside Hel’s house before. 

They’d met outside a few times—always neutral ground, always somewhere she could keep an eye on her surroundings—but she’d never invited him in. He hadn’t even been sure of the District in which she lived for the longest time, and it was only after she and Latham were ‘official’ that he’d learned that. 

Some people in Soar liked to make their homes known, marking their doorsteps with runes of status or banners advertising their profession. Which, of course, was very much not Hel’s style. It wasn’t exactly surprising that someone who’d spent most of her life in an Out of Bounds - only to get spectacularly fucked over by the Council - might have a few trust issues with sharing her post code. 

So to be suddenly dragged across her threshold with urgency? As far as Lowe was concerned, that wasn’t nothing. 

The door slammed shut behind them, and Hel stepped past him, glancing out of a curtained window before pulling it shut. Only once she seemed satisfied did she turn to him properly, her expression tense. “Well? Did anyone follow you here?” 

"Not that I noticed. But apparently, my tail-spotting skills aren’t what they used to be." 

Hel gave a short nod, then stepped back, finally giving him a moment to actually look at where she’d brought him. 

It very much wasn’t what he’d expected. 

If he’d had to guess, he’d have put money on the decor of Hel’s inner sanctum being entirely sparse. Cold. A survivalist’s bunker masquerading as a home—something filled with weapons, tactical maps, and just enough furniture to keep the place from looking entirely abandoned. 

But instead… 

There were windmills. 

Hundreds of them. 

Each spinning and swaying in all the way up her maintained front garden, their tiny enchanted turbines turning with a sound so soft it barely registered. They’d lined the path he’d just walked down in neat rows, gleaming silver and bronze. But what was crazy was that the theme continued inside. Countless windmills lined shelves that looked like they’d been purposely built to hold them. Some were old and weathered, others newer and much more polished. A mobile of them hung in the corner of the room, each little figure suspended by near-invisible threads, wind catching the faintest shifts in the air. 

Of all the things he might have expected from Hel, this hadn’t been one of them. 

"You really like windmills, huh?" 

"You going to be a dick about it?" 

"Not at all," he said, raising his hands. "Just… wasn’t expecting it." 

"It’s a Tyrant thing. Or, at least, a me thing. Wind’s the element of freedom, right? And a windmill… it works with it. It doesn’t fight it. It turns because it has to. Because it’s built to. Thought it was a nice idea when I was a kid. Guess I never grew out of it." 

"Honestly, Hel, I like it. I was expecting something more, I don’t know… stabby." 

Hel did smile at that, though it was brief. "Don’t get me wrong, I have a whole dedicated to that." 

"Of course you do." 

She gestured for him to follow her through the house. It was small, Lowe thought, but not cramped. Functional, but not unfeeling. A fireplace sat unlit in one corner of the living room, a few books stacked haphazardly on the mantel. Of course, there was also a heavy punching bag hanging from the rafters, positioned next to a battered wooden table that had seen better days. 

Surprisingly, it struck him that it was a house that was very much lived in. 

His reading of her had always been that Hel was a transient person. A destructive presence that moved through the world without fully settling anywhere. Without ever letting people see too far past the surface. Not unlike a tornado, now he thought of it. He wasn’t sure he’d ever imagined her belonging somewhere. Let alone in a place that felt like… this. He wondered what Latham made of it.

"Now do you see why I don’t have many guests?" she said dryly, catching his expression. 

"I can certainly see why you wouldn’t want me in here. I have so many questions about the obsessive windmill collecting." 

"Yeah, well. You can save them for when you’re dead. And, incidentally, if you bring them up again, I will kill you." 

"Noted," he said. Then, quieter, almost to himself: "Tilting at windmills, as ever." There was the briefest hitch in her step as she led him through to what looked like a small study. Then a sharp buffet of wind caught him on the side of the head, and he decided against any further jokes. 

This wasn’t just a study. The papers on the wooden desk weren’t scattered, they were sorted—names, routes, debts. Neither was the map of Soar pinned to the wall a travel guide; it was a hunting ground, key locations marked with quiet intent. Knives rested in easy reach, a coil of garrote wire lay beside an oil lamp, and a row of vials sat neatly in a case—liquids thick, dark, or strangely clear. 

Yes. This was much more like he’d expected.

She grabbed two glasses and a bottle of what looked like milk from a side cabinet, pouring them both a measure before sinking into a chair. “This has been a day." 

Lowe eyed the milk with deep suspicion. He wasn’t the sort to turn down a drink, but he also wasn’t the sort to die foaming at the mouth in some backroom study. Before he could voice this concern, she sighed and gestured vaguely toward the shelves. 

“The cheapest poison I own costs more than your house,” she said. “If I wanted you dead, I’d just—oh, I don’t know—chop your head off.” 

This did not help Lowe relax. 

Lowe took the seat across from her, rolling his shoulders, trying to shake off the lingering effect of the hot chocolate buff. It had mellowed now, but the whole thing had left him far too comfortable. And he hated that. “You sounded like something had really pissed you off.”

"Yeah, I’ll get to that.” Hel glared at him. “You any further on what is going on here?”

“Maybe. I think I remembered something," he said. 

"Something useful?" 

"That’s the problem," he said. "I don’t know." 

She didn’t press, just took a slow sip of her drink, watching him over the rim. 

"I was thinking about the Black Knight. About the first time we were closing in on him. The last case we worked before… well. Before it all went wrong." 

Hel didn’t say anything. Didn’t need to.Help support creative writers by finding and reading their stories on the original site.

Lowe took a tentative sip and, as he didn’t die horribly, took another. "I remembered sitting around in my flat with my old squad. Talking through the case. The way we used to. But, right at the end, I realised that something was wrong." 

"How do you mean?" 

Lowe set the glass down on the table next to him and drummed his fingers against the wood. "One of my team. Coda. He talked about something he shouldn’t have known." 

"Okay. And that’s enough to make you think Coda was working with the Black Knight?" 

"I don’t know," Lowe said. "But it means something, Hel. It has to." 

She was silent for a long moment, swirling the liquid in her glass. Finally, she said "Okay. So what are you planning to do about it?" 

"I honestly don’t know. Figure out what the fuck I missed, I guess. And why I’m only remembering it now." 

Before Hel could say anything else, though, Lowe’s Sending Stone buzzed sharply. He frowned, reaching for it. The rune flared. Hel. Which was impossible, considering she was sitting right in front of him . . .

He met her gaze, seeing his own confusion reflected back at him. Still, he activated the connection, pressing the stone to his ear. “Lowe! We’ve all been fucking ambushed. Don’t worry, everyone’s still in one piece, but you need to get somewhere with lots of people. Preferably the Temple and Latham, if you can. Whoever they are, these guys are good!” 

A hand snapped across the distance between them as ‘Hel’ plucked the Sending Stone from Lowe’s grasp with the unhurried grace of someone picking up a teacup. The ease of it nearly fooled him as to the power in that grasp. Nearly. But beneath that action lay an unnatural strength. 

Not-Hel lifted the Stone to her lips and spoke— but it was his voice that was coming out. 

"Thanks for the heads-up, Hel! Are you guys sure you're all okay?" 

"Yeah," Hel answered. "Nothing we couldn't handle. Apparently Ortel is an absolute beast! But we can catch you up with what happened later. It’s more important that you get to safety first. We all got absolutely jumped the second we left your house. It looks like someone is trying to wipe you and yours." 

"Fuck! Well, thanks for letting me know. I'll get to Latham as quick as possible," not-Hel said, still wearing his voice like a second skin. 

Lowe pushed himself up, mouth opening to shout a warning, but the backhand came before the words. Then he was flying through the air, his skull cracking against the wall with a crunch. Lowe’s world strobed white, and blood filled his mouth. 

Blood of the Phoenix triggered.

That blow had one-shotted him. Not Hel had killed him. 

Whoever this was either knew about his Roll with the Punches Skill upgrade, or she'd just casually committed murder. Putting all his gold on the latter - especially as he was now incapable of being healed for the foreseeable - Lowe let himself stay limp as his killer kept chatting to his friend - with his voice - as if nothing at all had happened.

"Well, I’m sure glad you are all okay. But, now I think about it, I’m not sure about going to the Temple on my own. Might be best if I catch up with you first? Maybe we meet up and then go to Latham together? Just to be sure. Somewhere safe." 

“Sure,” Hel said. “Where do you think you can get you and Mylaf to quickly?”

“It’ll just be me. I can’t imagine anyone will be too bothered with a Drudge. I’ll leave her here. It’s not like she’s irreplaceable anyway, is it? Any rendezvous suggestions?” 

There was a long pause.“How about the place we first met?” 

"Absolutely. Great call. Just in case my memory is on the fritz - it’s been a long day! - can you just remind me?" 

“It was pretty memorable, Lowe. I cut your arm off.” 

Not-Hel shifted slightly, adjusting the way they held the Sending Stone. "Oh, yeah! It was in Jewel Town, right?" 

Hel laughed—light, easy, but there was a steel wire running through it. “Not even close. Try again.” 

A longer hesitation. Too long. Not-Hel recovered fast, but the warmth in their voice had a manufactured edge now. "Hel, seriously, what’s with the pop quiz? You just said everything’s fine, didn’t you?" 

"Yeah," Hel agreed. "We’re fine. But you don't sound like you believe me." 

Not-Hel hesitated again, then forced a laugh. "Look, I was just worried. You know me—big worrier." 

"Uh-huh. And that's why you want to meet before going to Latham? Just to check in?" 

"Yeah! I mean, can you blame me?" Not-Hel let out another fake chuckle. "Better safe than sorry, right?" 

“Sure. So, where did we first meet, Jana?”

“I—why the hell does this matter?” 

"It doesn’t," Hel said, voice still easy, still unreadable. "Unless, of course, you don’t know . . ." 

Not-Hel swore then crushed my Sending Stone to dust.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, like ink spreading in water, Not-Hel’s form bled into something else. Arms and legs stretched, her features dissolved and reformed, and where the Wind Tyrant’s stolen face had been, there was now a nondescript man. He was average height, average build, and with a forgettable kind of banalness that would blend into any crowd. 

Without moving, Lowe focused on the space above the man’s head. 

Shimmerskin, Level 62.

Fuck, Lowe though. A shapeshifter. And a strong one. Well, that explained being one-shotted . . . 

The Shimmerskin reached into his coat and pulled out a Sending Stone of his own. “Drefleck here,” he said. “Yeah, no dice. The fucking Wind Tyrant called him before I got anything good. Wasn't Syncler supposed to have taken care of her?” A pause. Then his expression darkened. “Fuck, really?” More pause. “Okay. Well, add that to the list of colossal screwups this week. No, I had to drop him. Got nothing new.” 

Lowe lay still. Dead men, after all, didn’t move. 

“Okay, well we go to Plan . . . where are we at? D? E? I’ll finish up here and cycle back to base. See if you can get a line on where they all went.” Drefleck said, then muttered something under his breath as he tucked his Sending Stone away. He looked around the study and took one last glance at Lowe’s crumpled body, before reaching into his inventory. 

A dull metal sphere settled into the man’s palm, and by the way his hand dipped, it was heavier than it had any right to be. Lowe did his best to squint at him, brain working through the possibilities. He’d seen things like this before. This was a Scorcher. It was a device that was used when you positively, absolutely did not want to leave any evidence behind. They were actually prohibited in Soar as they didn’t just make fire—no, fire at least had the decency to leave behind a bit of ash and a moral lesson about proper storage. This would erase Hel’d house so thoroughly that, years later, people would swear there had never been anything there to begin with.

Drefleck rolled it in his fingers, then clicked a small switch on its side. Then he tossed it towards the corner of the room. 

Lowe didn’t see where it landed, but he heard the whump of mana priming, the deep, pressurised hiss as whatever fuel Scorchers used began to spread across the floor. Drefleck didn’t even watch. He was already turning, already walking away and out of the house. 

Almost immediately, a wall of heat slammed through the room, sucking the air from Lowe’s lungs. Fire bloomed, hungry and unchecked, seemingly swallowing everything in seconds. The walls of Hel’s house shuddered as flames licked up them, and smoke billowed thick and choking, turning Lowe’s world into a smothering haze. 

He stayed still. He had to. If Drefleck even suspected he was still alive, he’d be back to finish the job. 

But the fire didn’t care about that detail.

It spread with terrifying speed, creeping across the floorboards and devouring the furniture in the study. The smoke was as thick as oil, and Lowe’s lungs were already screaming for air. He couldn’t keep playing dead any longer, and his body twitched, coughing, every instinct screaming at him to move. 

It seemed Drefleck was gone. 

His fingers twitched against the charred wood beneath him, his breath coming in gasps. It wasn’t so long ago he’d allowed himself to be burned alive in order to kill a Dungeon monster. It was at times like this that he really saw the value of Roll with the Punches.

The door out of the study was already filled with fire; there was no way he was getting through there without needing a heal. 

Think. Think. 

He had nothing. No Roll with the Punches. No escape item. There was nothing he could use— 

No. That wasn’t quite true, was it?

Something curled deep inside him, faint but present. There was a whisper of Pressure around his ribs. 

He grasped at it. His Shackled Grasp. It had held on to something from the attack. Not much—the power of whatever the Shimmerskin had hit him with had mostly bled away. Lowe assumed that was because, to all intents and purposes, it had actually killed him. But there was still the thinnest chain of it there, pulsing weakly in his Core. 

He swallowed against the smoke. 

Could he use it? Not in retaliation; that would be pointless. Likewise, there was no way it would work to heal him up with the Blood of the Phoenix countdown running. However, if he dumped what little Pressure he had into the AoE version of the release, would the concussive blast be enough to blow out the flames? 

Or would it just make everything worse? 

Could things be worse?

Flames crawled closer, licking at the edges of his vision. His lungs burned. No time to think. Lowe made a choice. 

He let the Pressure go.

            







	***





                “I just don’t think you quite understood the, you know, general thrust of the story of the Three Little Pigs. We’re not supposed to see the actions of the Big Bad Wolf as an instruction manual. In general, blowing the house down should not be considered a first port of call in a crisis. And especially not in the fucking house of Wind Tyrant! Didn’t it occur to you that Hel would have all sorts of defence runes ready to kick in the moment the flames got too bad?”

“I don’t know, Latham. I’d just been killed. I guess I wasn’t thinking too clearly.”

The remnants of Hel’s house still smoldered around them, the occasional ember flickering among the collapsed beams. Smoke curled lazily into the night air, and somewhere beneath the rubble, something popped as it finally succumbed to the fire’s hunger. There weren’t very many windmills left anymore.

Lowe sat on a piece of charred wood, elbows resting on his knees, trying not to think too hard about how close he’d come to cooking alive. He still smelled like soot and burning hair, which - in his vast experience - was rarely a sign he was winning in life. And he’d ruined another suit. 

If the Shimmerskin didn’t come back and get him, Mylaf was going to have his arse . . .  

Latham sat beside him, looking just as miserable, twirling a burnt splinter between his fingers like it was the most interesting thing in the world.  “You know,” Latham said, “most people who survive an assassination attempt lie low for a while.”  

“Yeah?” Lowe coughed, still tasting smoke in his lungs. “And what do you think I’m doing right now?”  

“Not lying low enough. You could at least have the decency to look a little more corpse-like. Proper dead people don’t sit up and start making quips about their own murder.”  

“Give me a break. I’m between deaths right now.”  

“Little man, I swear, sometimes I think you just get into all this trouble for the attention”  

Lowe laughed weakly and then coughed. He knew Latham wasn’t really joking, not entirely. He could hear it in his voice, the way the usual humour had a thread of something heavier running beneath it. Concern. The kind neither of them was ever going to acknowledge directly.  

To save his friend his blushes, Lowe turned away and stared down the street. A couple of Temple Warders stood at attention, their gleaming armour catching the glow of the still-burning remains of Hel’s house. Their presence was a message in itself—nobody was getting through that perimeter unless they wanted to take on the personal wrath of the Temple. 

Lowe wondered whether this was Latham calling in some favours or if someone - or something - else was pulling strings on his behalf. The last time he’d had official Warder protection - during the Gianna d’Avec case - things had got very messy before they got much better . . .

He knew Latham was anxious about Hel. She’d, apparently, ‘gone to ground’ in the way only someone with Hel’s Skills could. It looked like, at the same time, she’d gathered together the rest of their little group - other than Rook, who’d messaged to say he’d point-blank refused to go with her when she’d showed up at his door- and vanished from Soar. If Lowe had to put money on it, he’d assume she was calling in on the farm of a certain Berseker Balloon and Nightmare Reaver. Probably catching up with some family too . . .  

Lowe was glad that she’d thought to gather up the rest of the team - and that Arebella, in particular, was out of the firing line - but worried that the necessity of this completely undermined the little investigatory plan they’d only just managed to put into action.

Mind you, that had probably been the point of all the attempted murders, right? Didn’t someone seem pretty well-informed about what Lowe had been planning to do?

So, rather than a pretty effective group of people with exactly the right sort of Skills to help him unravel what was going on, Team Anti-Black Knight was down to just Lowe, Latham and Rook. That two of the three had already had their arses handed to them by that particular opponent didn’t make it feel like the rematch was all going all that well.

They hadn’t quite received a knockout punch this morning, but it wasn’t too far away.

“How much longer?” Latham said. The urgency in his voice suggested Lowe wasn’t the only one who wanted to get things moving.

“For what?”  

“For your stupid healing cooldown to reset.” He gestured vaguely. “Because before we do anything stupidly dangerous, I’d like you to be less squishy if possible. I’d like to be able to concentrate on delivering a little mayhem, rather than playing nursemaid.”  

“Fair enough,” Lowe checked his Core. “Looks like two minutes? Maybe five so that I have spare mana available?”  

“If I haven’t already made it clear, your Skillset is simply the worst. I’ve got places to go. People to kill. I shouldn’t be sat around like this.”  

“Hey, don’t let me stop you, mate. Apparently, you’re all about abandoning the people you love because you have other places to be. If you couldn’t be bothered to stick around and have Hel’s back, why should I be the exception?”  

“Fuck you, little man!”

“Right back at you, big fella. With knobs on. Which, considering some of the toys I saw in Hel’s study, looks like it might very much be your thing.” Lowe paused. “Yeah, that was too far, wasn’t it? Sorry about that. Blame it on the smoke inhalation.”

“Don’t worry about it. You just died again. If you can’t be a wanker when bouncing back from that, when can you?”

“Fair enough.”

“But, on any other day, you’d be regrowing your teeth about now.”  

“Which would be entirely fair,” Lowe said. He reached up and put his hand on the Temple Warder’s arm. “Hel will be okay. If they didn’t get her when he guard was down, they absolutely aren’t getting anywhere near her now that she’s into hunter-killer mode. And trust me, Karolen’s no pushover here. Once they all meet up with the rest of her team, I doubt there’s anything in Soar to touch them.”  

“Yeah, I know.” Latham stretched out his legs, staring at the wreckage. “But I’m struggling to emotionally process that my best friend got killed tonight, someone tried to murder my girlfriend and then burned her house down while I wasn’t around to do anything about it. It’s a lot.”  

“Not a fan of the whole helplessness thing?”  

“No, Lowe, I am not a fan. Not even a little. It’s put a dent in my whole day.”  

“That almost sounded like feelings.”  

Latham reached over and thumped him on the back, hard. “I’m done sharing. Much more emoting and out periods are going to sync up. Let’s move on.”  

Lowe winced. There was still about a minute before he could begin to heal. “Noted.”  

They sat in silence for a moment, watching the flames continue to dwindle.  

Then Latham sighed. “So, uh… I don’t suppose you have any ideas about why someone suddenly decided to take us all out, do you?”  

“Actually, yes I do. And none of them are good.”  

“Figured as much.”  

They fell back into silence, the distant murmur of the Warders bitching about standing around the only sound in the street.  

Then Lowe felt something shift within him. A pulse of warmth he’d never missed so much in his life. It was the slow, steady hum of mana returning to his body.  His cooldown was up, which meant Roll with the Punches could get immediately to work. “Okay,” he said, finally able to take a proper breath. “I think it’s time to get back to the land of the fully living.”  

“You sure? Or do you need another five minutes of being a dramatic little shit?”  

“Oh, I’m sure. But hey, I appreciate all the epic concern.”  

Lowe focused on Roll with the Punches and manually directed it as it surged through his veins. As a passive Skill, it was great, but sometimes it was necessary to focus on the parts of him he needed to have priority attention.

“Don’t suppose you have any ideas where we’re going to start?” Lowe said, standing up.

“Oh, yes,” Latham said, and the way he suddenly grinned made Lowe very glad the Temple Warder was on his side. “Apparently, Hel has left us both a goodbye present.”

***

All things considered, Syncler had experienced better weeks.  This tale has been unlawfully obtained from Royal Road. If you discover it on Amazon, kindly report it.

For a start, spending the past forty-eight hours walking around in the skin of the Warden of the Reserve’s Personal Assistant had been nothing short of excruciating. The man was walrus-like in both appearance and temperament, shuffling through life with the unearned authority of a Grade A Wankpuffin who made Syncler want to punch his face in. Of course, what was even worse was that Morholt apparently had free and easy access privileges to the poor woman. 

He’d needed to nip that in the bud. Hard.  

Oh, and then, there was the fuck-up at the morning meeting. With that cockroach from Cuckoo House.  

Their files on this guy had described him as of minor concern. A useful washout who might be usable under the right circumstances, but hardly a threat. That file had, as it turned out, been somewhat wrong. Because somehow, against all reason, the little shit had peeled back Syncler’s Malign Influence like old paint, resisting in ways he shouldn’t have been able to. 

And kicked back, into the bargain. 

Any hint that he possessed those sorts of mental resiliencies should have been mentioned in his dossier. Which, frankly, raised some very concerning questions about what else might have been missed . . .

Oh, and to cap off this steaming, fly-ridden pile of excrement in his morning breakfast baguette he had then gotten himself thoroughly and professionally battered. Violently. By a disavowed Out of Bounds agent who should have been dead a year ago. Synchler had never, for a moment, thought he’d need to step in against

To be fair, they’d not taken Hel lightly. None of them had, and the hit on her had been meticulously planned.  Their squad was formidable, but even that hadn’t seemed like enough—not for someone with her reputation. So, they’d contracted outside, pulling in a local specialist. A Soar knife professional with no allegiances, no hesitation, and a quickly growing reputation for making tricky problems disappear for the right price.  

Belt and braces. Nothing left to chance.  

And yet in moments, the pro went down, and Synchler found himself in the wrong body watching the entire plan go up in flames.  

It wasn’t supposed to go this way.  

If he’d known—if he’d even suspected for a second—that he’d have to step in personally, against the fucking woman he wouldn’t still be wearing the fucking Personal Assistant. There were far more appropriate forms for that sort of work. Ones built for combat. For durability. For taking a Wind Tyrant and not being turned into a fine mist of regret and shattered bone. But there hadn’t been time. 

But that wasn’t the worst of it. 

No, the worst of it was that she hadn’t killed him . . .

Then the darkness around him was abruptly interrupted as someone lifted the lid on the - very small - storage chest the Wind Bitch had crammed his unconscious form into and he was pulled roughly out and suspended in the air inches from the face of a very pissed off Temple Warder.

Fuck. My. Life. 

***

“You see,” Latham said, “the amazing thing about a Shimmerskin is that you can pull all sorts of pieces off them and, more or less, it grows right back.”  

Synchler - if that was really this guy’s name. Although, Lowe thought, he was pretty sure there was limited value in him lying considering what was being done to him - screamed as Latham demonstrated his theory with a casual tug. This led to a wet schlck as an ear came loose between his fingers. The shapeshifter’s whole body shuddered as he struggled to mend himself even as his face twisted in agony.  

“Of course,” Latham continued, turning the ear over in his fingers like he was judging the quality of a gemstone, “that can’t go on forever. These sneaky fuckers have a core mass, and eventually, with enough persistence, you can whittle away at that and really start to make inroads”  

Another sharp, wet tear. Another scream. A finger, this time, rolling across the floor like a discarded marble.  

Lowe stood to the side, face going increasingly pale.. This wasn’t his first brutal interrogation. Fuck, it wasn’t even his first interrogation where the floor was quickly swimming with blood and body parts. But still, there was something appalling about the detached way Latham was going about his work. 

“But, funnily enough, that isn’t even in the top five problems for anyone who chooses this Class has,” Latham went on, crouching slightly to meet the Shimmerskin’s wild, panicked eyes. “Chief among the reasons Shimmerskin isn’t more popular is that their patron god absolutely does not give two flying fucks about them.”  

Synchler was shaking now, sweat beading on his forehead as his flesh struggled to knit itself back together. He opened his mouth, maybe to spit some defiance—maybe to beg—but Latham still wasn’t finished.  

“You see, for most gods, there’s a whole ‘these ants are made in my own image’ thing going on. I mean, most of them still don’t care about us, but usually, with enough panicked prayers, most of them are, eventually, likely to step in if one of their worshippers is getting, for example, horrifically tortured.”  

Another rip. Another scream.  

Lowe felt that one. Deep in his bones. The way the sound of the man’s horror curled, raw and jagged, twisting through the air. His fingers clenched against his arms, and he forced himself to stay still.  

Latham, by contrast, hadn’t even flinched. “However,” he said, “the most famous of Jinoporan’s Commandments is that he really doesn’t want to hear any ballaching from whiny mortals.”  

Lowe had known about Jinoporan’s indifference to his worshippers. But theory was very different to practice. Watching the assassin’s face contort in the certain knowledge that no divine hand was coming to save him? That was something else.  

“Don’t get me wrong. This Class has some great Threshold rewards,” Latham said, wiping his bloodied hands on a rag. “But I’m not still sure it makes up for the epically poor aftercare service. What do you think, mate? Any buyers remorse yet?”  

Synchler’s chest heaved. He was pale now, his regenerations coming slower and his breath rattling wetly in his throat.  

“No answer?” Latham said. “Pity. You see, in my experience, the sort of person who doesn’t mind if their god doesn’t have their back means Shimmerskins tend to fall into one of two camps. Some of them are seriously brave motherfuckers. Great working undercover. Fantastic as spies. Perfect for really dangerous work Out . . . Of . . . Bounds,”  Latham stressed those last three words and then tilted his head. “But then, of course, there’s the other kind.”  

He reached out, grabbed hold of Synchler’s nose, and pulled.  

The resulting scream was raw and ugly. It made the hairs on the back of Lowe’s neck stand up.  

Latham let the bloody scrap of cartilage fall to the ground, watching as the shapeshifter’s face writhed, his body trying to rebuild what had been lost. But Lowe noticed something—the nose that was forming back wasn’t quite right. Slightly smaller. The symmetry was off.  

They were getting to the core mass now.  

“Latham, aren’t you going to ask him any questions?”  

“Of course, little man. But first, I think we all need to get on the same page.”  

He turned back to the Shimmerskin. Another rip. Another scream.  

Lowe swallowed, watching as the assassin’s body tried to hold its shape despite the constant, methodical dismemberment.  

Latham was speaking again, his tone almost gentle. “The thing is, this guy has made all sorts of choices for his life to reach this point.” He turned slightly, gesturing toward Lowe with a bloodied hand. “Think of all the things he must have decided to do in order to reach the stage where his next obvious action was to attempt to kill someone I care about. What’s happening here is not an unfortunate accident. He has selected this outcome with intent. This is something on which I think he should reflect.”  

Lowe looked back down at Synchler, who was now shivering violently, his remaining fingers twitching in aborted attempts to clutch at himself.  

“This is happening to him,” Latham said, “because he actively chose it. If it wasn’t for the choice’s he’d made, there would be an awful lot more of him left right now. It is important he understands that.”  

Rip. Scream.  

“He needs to appreciate that all this,” Latham continued, “is not anything to do with me at all. This fucker has put himself into this situation.”  He knelt slightly, looking the man in the eye.  “And I would really like to help him find a way out.”  

Lowe made a face. “Really?”  

Latham stilled. For a moment, there was only the distant drip of blood, the wet sound of Synchler’s trembling breaths. Then he turned to look at Lowe. And there were tears in his eyes.  “Of course,” Latham said, voice quieter now. “You think this is how I want to spend my time?”  

Lowe stayed silent.

“I don’t like this, Lowe. You think I enjoy pulling some poor bastard apart piece by piece? That I want to be the one who has to do this?” Latham shook his head. “I just know that if I don’t, people I care about are going to die.” He looked back at Synchler, who was now staring at the floor, lips moving soundlessly.  

“Is this a private torture session, or can anyone join?”  

Both Lowe and Latham spun at the voice. Lowe activated Slugger whilst a humongous sword was suddenly in Latham’s hands..  

Rook was stood just behind them. He looked entirely too at ease for someone who had apparently materialised in the middle of a secured basement torture session in the bowels of the Celestial Temple. His eyes flicked between them, then down to the Shimmerskin’s twitching, half-reformed body.

“How the fuck did you end up here!” Latham said. “There’s enough anti-teleport runes in the walls to stop a fucking Avatar getting in without using a portal stone!”  

Rook grinned, slow and easy, like he hadn’t just given both of them minor heart attacks. “Chill your beans.” He stepped forward, gaze still locked on the ruined sight of the Shimmerskin. “Threshold Guardian, right?” He tapped his chest with two fingers. “This guy’s circling the drain so hard, I could hear him from the other side of Soar. I can zero in on this sort of pain anywhere within my range and puff here I am.”  

Lowe blinked. "You could hear him?”  

Rook lifted a shoulder. “Well, not him exactly.” He crouched slightly, head tilting as he studied the way Synchler’s still-bloody skin kept rippling, warping, trying and failing to hold form. “More like… the part of him that’s getting ready to pack it in and shuffle off.”  

Latham gave Rook a long look. “And what? You just followed that?”  

“Threshold Guardian perks, big guy.” Rook tapped his temple. “When someone’s straddling the line between ‘alive’ and ‘gently decomposing,’ it pings. And I’ve got to say, you’ve really done a number on this one. Haven’t seen a soul cling to their body this hard in a while.”  

“We were in the middle of an interrogation, actually,” Lowe said.  

“And how’s that working out for you?”  

Lowe looked downwards. The Shimmerskin’s breath was coming in thin gasps, his body still trembling with the effort of holding together despite Latham’s persistence. Rook was right. This guy was circling the drain, alright. “We’re getting to it.”

“Yeah, well take it from me. You’re gonna want to hurry that up,” Rook said.  

Latham’s expression darkened. “Why?”  

“Because he’s about to slip.” Rook brushed non-existent dust off his threadbare coat. “And trust me, you do not want to have to go and try to fetch his soul if it ends up past the threshold. That sort of thing leaves a mark.”  

Lowe glanced at Latham, who wasn’t looking at Rook anymore. His gaze was on Synchler. It was time to wrap this up.  “Okay,” he said, crouching next to the assassin. “You said you’d talk?”  

Synchler let out something that might have been a laugh if it weren’t so wrecked. “I’ve been telling you I want to talk!” He tried to lift his head, but his muscles gave out halfway. “F-fuck, man, just ask me some questions.”  

Time to get some answers.

            







	***





                Lowe had always considered himself a tea man.  

It was a small thing. A link to something resembling normalcy in a city where the lines between life and death blurred far too easily. The simple act of pushing mana into a rune, boiling the water, steeping leaves, and taking that first sip had always been an effective way to calm him down. It might not have been as effective as one of Mylaf’s mugs of hot chocolate, but it was a ritual that, over the years, had worked more often than it didn’t

Except, right now, his hands weren’t steady. Not at all.

The porcelain cup rattled as he set it down. He reached for the pan - it was nice how Temple torture chambers came with all the modern conveniences - and it filled with cold water as he touched it. The sound of bubbling water was far too much like the gurgling, choking gasps that had filled the basement only a bell earlier.

The Shimmerskin had died. Eventually.  

There hadn’t been much of an option over that. Not really. You didn’t fuck up a Level 51 assassin who could change their appearance and then pat him on the backside and wish him a good day. You just couldn’t let someone like that walk away after tearing bits off him until he told you all his secrets.

The Shimmerskin had told them everything he knew about what was going on, right up until his body started failing him. The core mass had been slipping, his powers of regeneration stalling after so much punishment, and his voice had turned thin and reedy. At the end, he was more fear than flesh. And then Rook had stepped forward.  

Lowe’s fingers twitched as he flicked the rune to ignite the heating mechanism of the pan, and watched as flames bloomed around it. He could still see it. The way Rook had crouched beside the dying assassin and murmured something too quiet to catch. The way his hands had been gentle when they settled on either side of the man’s head.  

Then, a sharp twist. A crack.  

It had been quick. Cleaner than Lowe had expected. A quiet end to a process that had been anything but.  

Lowe gritted his teeth as he grabbed the tea tin from his inventory. But his hands weren’t shaking anymore. They were clenching. He forced himself to take a breath. They had what they needed, and they had done what needed doing.  And yet—  

“Hmm, I hit Level 50 with that,” Rook had said, glowing briefly gold as he selected his Threshold reward. Then he’d stepped back, stretching as if he’d just finished a particularly satisfying workout.  

Lowe had barely noticed. His attention had been on Latham.  

The big man had stood frozen, his hands still slick with blood. His breathing had been steady, but his face had been unreadable. Not blank. Not uncaring. Just… still. He hadn’t said anything. Not to Lowe. Not to Rook. Not to the corpse cooling at their feet.  

Lowe exhaled sharply as the water bubbled up and over the pan. He lifted the pan and poured it into the cup too fast, nearly spilling as he overfilled. Sloppy. He scowled at himself, grabbing a spoon and stirring with unnecessary force, watching as the dark tendrils of tea swirled into the water.  

The Shimmerskin’s blood had swirled the same way on the basement floor. Lowe squeezed his eyes shut. Just drink the fucking tea, Lowe. He took a sip. 

It tasted like ash.  

***

"Okay," Lowe said. "So, let’s go over it all again. Slowly, for those of us who have recently been murdered and then set on fire."  

"Just so we know, how long are you going to be playing the ‘wah, I died again’ card?" Latham said. “Your man Rook over there’s literally been dying for the last year, and you don’t hear all this whinging from him.”  

Lowe ignored him. He was too tired to banter properly, and he still hadn’t finished his goddamn tea.  

Across from them, Rook stood with his back against the wall, flicking through the notes he had made. "Our late lamented friend said that his company was contracted a Fourteenday ago," he said. "On a standard ‘Watch and Wait’ brief. They were to use their Skills to ‘replace’ a number of employees at the Sovereign Bank of Soar and make a record of anything unusual that they noted."  

"Which probably included the Vault being robbed and a bunch of their fellow mercenaries being murdered?"  

"He certainly believed that fulfilled the ‘unusual’ element of their brief."  

"By the way, what did we make of ‘replace’ there?” Lowe said. “That doesn’t sound like anything good for the missing employees of the Vault.”

“He was clear that wasn’t anything to do with his crew," Rook said, flicking to a new page and quoting. How the client makes space for us to move in is none of our business.’"  Stolen content warning: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.

Lowe hadn’t liked that answer the first time he’d heard it. He felt he was developing some serious questions to be put to the Warden of the Reserve. Because, after all, wasn’t the thing with Shimmerskins? People didn’t just casually step aside for them to replace. They were, most usually, violently removed so a new body could take their place, with the world moving on, none the wiser. He feared this case had already picked up all sorts of casualties before he was even on it.

"But he didn’t know who the client actually was,” Rook continued. “Turns out our Synchler was a grunt rather than the Grunter. All he was clear on was that ‘Watch and Wait’ contract was replaced by a ‘kill Lowe and all his friends’ after the robbery occurred and a bunch of his mates were wiped.”

"Because," Latham said grimly, "someone was cleaning up."  

“But that makes no sense,” Lowe said. “I’ve got both the Mayor and the Warden of the Reserve on my arse to solve this case! There’s no way either of them wasted a shedload of gold on a bunch of assassins to kill me.”

“Well, someone hired an entire Out of Bounds company to sit and watch the bank well before you became involved,” Rook said. “And then, after all hell broke loose and bunch of them were killed, I presume the same someone gave the order to wipe us all out. Remember, the Warden and the Mayor are far from the only people in Soar with the gold to do that. Presumably, whoever is holding the Shimmerskin’s reins wants access to the same unidentified missing thing as those guys. And rather than see you and yours as a path to it, chose to view you as an embuggerance.”

"Well," Lowe said. "That’s not fucking ominous at all, is it?"

“Which brings us back to the Black Knight,” Latham said. “Is he paying the Shimmerskins?”

“If he is, he chose to kill a bunch of them in the Vault. I think we all agree The Black Knight is unlikely to be a model of empathetic interpersonal relations, but it seems a touch . . . unlikely for him to have done that,” Rook said

“Okay. Okay. So someone figured out something important was in the Vault. Something the Warden and the Mayor were happy to sit there undisturbed. In order to get it, we know they ‘replaced’ a bunch of Vault staff with Shimmerskins a Forteenday back. That’s a pretty substantial financial input - OOBS don’t come cheap. But then, the Black Knight - for reasons that, right now, passeth understanding - got in there, somehow wiped these very strong military types all out, took the aretefact for himself and left a ‘come and get me sailor’ message for you, little man. At which stage, the Warden of the Reserve - who had his own Shimmerskin keeping an eye on him - and the Mayor decide to get up close and personal with you and put on all the pressure. That cover it?” Latham seemed to have rallied after this little torture session.

“Not quite,” Lowe said, spinning the manacle on his wrist around. “Because, somewhere in the middle of all this, I think Arkola’s fucking around too.”

Neither Rook nor Latham reacted to that for a moment. There’s something about being told a literal god - and not just any god, the god - is taking in an interest in your daily life to make you go a bit quiet. It was Latham who found his voice first. “Excellent. Because what this situation needs right now is more stakes. Why the fuck do you think Arkola is involved?”

Lowe held up his wrist. “This, for starters. It’s just the sort of unnecessarily overpowered trinket I’m likely to need if I’m going to make it through all this alive.” A memory of being casually backhanded to death in Hel’s house tried to surface, but Lowe pressed it down. “And the message when I received it in the Dungeon made clear that Arkola would be happy for me to have a chat about the case if I got stuck.’ And then there’s, well, you,” Lowe said, looking at Rook. 

“You think Arkola turned me into a Threshold Guardian so that, a year after I should have died, I happened to still be about to help you? Self-absorbed much?”

“You can be a prick about it, but I think that's what happened.” Lowe was aware of how ridiculous that sounded. “You have to admit, it seems like a bit of a coincidence otherwise, doesn’t it? The Black Knight comes back, and - what do you know! -  you’re here to help me bring him down. The more I think about it, the more I think perhaps I should take it up on the offer of a chat?”

“Nah, let’s park Arkola for now,” Latham said. “There may well be a time when a visit to the First Floor is the only path that’s left to us, but I don’t think we’re there yet. You need to remember that nothing comes from that direction for free,” he said, looking at Lowe’s manacle meaningfully. 

“As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport," Rook said. Both Lowe and Latham looked at him. “Sorry, I don’t know where that came from. The words just popped into my head.”

“Fair enough,” Lowe said, nodding to Latham. “I think you’re right. I don’t fancy being in the presence of Soar’s supreme being either. I think that’s likely to be the kind of card we get to play once. “

Latham was suddenly looking thoughtful. “Okay. Well, it strikes me that the be-all-and-end-all here is going to be whatever has gone awol from the Vault. We’ve got someone hiring Shimmerskins, we’ve got the Black Knight and we’ve got the Warden and the Mayor collectively losing their shit. We need to figure out what it is.”

“I know,” Lowe said. That was actually the thing he’d asked Karolen and Arebella to look into for him. He figured, between the two of them - with their Skillsets - they were the most likely to uncover some answers on that front in short order. But the attack from the Shimmerskins had put pay to any help coming to him from that quarter. There was going to be a hard limit to the amount of investigation those two were going to be able to do while Hel had them in hiding . . .

“What we really need,” Latham said, “is someone - and not a god - who we can get on our side, and who is too powerful to be able to be easily pushed around by the Mayor and the Warden, and also likely to have an insight as to what was being protected in the Vault.”

“Yeah,” Rook said. “What a shame there’s not anyone like that.”

“When you say ‘on our side’,” Lowe said, the beginnings of an idea forming in his mind, “exactly how long do you think it takes someone to get over being pissed off with me . . .”

            







	***





                Lowe stepped into the refurbished main hall of Soar Museum. The place was empty - it still had not properly opened to the public since the . . . incident with an escaped Dreadnaught, and the hush of the space was only broken by the slow, measured steps of a single figure coming down a grand staircase to meet him.

Grackle Nuroon still looked like a gargoyle who had been left too long in the wind. Sharp, worn, and bristling with irritation, even from across the space, Lowe could see the distinct twitch of his jaw and the barely-contained displeasure at having to suffer Lowe’s presence once again.

Which was a wonderful way to begin a sensitive meeting, Lowe thought.

“I must be getting sentimental in my old age,” Nuroon said. “The last time you darkened my door, I entertained very real thoughts of having you violently murdered. Yet, here you are, still breathing, still irritating, and - what is so much worse -  it does appear that I actually invited you in.”

Lowe took his time moving to meet the Director halfway. He had the distinct feeling that if he moved too fast, Nuroon would have him tranquilised and then strapped to one of the display counters and dissected just for the sheer pleasure of it. “Good to see you too, Grackle. You look well. Still terrifying museum staff for sport?”

“I have to find my entertainment where I can. Especially since my budget has recently been made rather tight.” Nuroon’s gaze flicked over him, eyes narrowing. “Is it just your usual hangdog appearance, Inspector, or have you recently been killed again recently?”

“Only a little bit,” Lowe said, both concerned that Nuroon appeared to know more about his Class than he should, but also pleased - considering his mission here - that the Director’s information gathering was undefeated. “It’s been a hell of a week.”

“And I don’t care.” Nuroon walked toward a side corridor without waiting to see if Lowe would follow. 

The repairs being done to the museum made the whole thing feel very different from the last time Lowe had been here. It was still vast and empty, like a tomb waiting to be filled, but now there were lots of new touches which felt oddly anachronistic. They passed through archways lined with relics of long-dead empires, alongside entirely modern mana walls and cutting-edge rune designs. Nuroon had always been particular about curation - although, not necessarily, the wellbeing of his Curators - and to see such a hodgepodge mixture of the old and the new was quite bizarre.  

The Director considered knowledge to be power, and he hoarded it like a dragon. Lowe wondered how he felt about having his own private empire of glass cases and forgotten texts invaded by all the newest innovations in Soar.

Eventually, after a good ten minutes of walking, they reached Nuroon’s office which - as it had been the last time Lowe had been here - was filled with books and heavy oak furniture. A fire burned low in the hearth, casting long shadows which hardly made the whole setting feel less sinister. Nuroon took his seat behind a desk and indicated for Lowe to do the same. “Well, now you are here, sit if you must.”

Lowe sat.

“I’m going to assume that the only reason you’re here is because you require something from me, and it is important enough that you think I’m not going to hold all sorts of grudges against you.”

“I do need some information.”

“And what makes you think I have it? Or, more importantly, I suppose, that I am going to be remotely interested in giving it to you.”

“Well, firstly, because you know everything,” Lowe said. “And secondly, because I think you’re going to be more interested in the chance to settle scores with the Mayor and the Warden of the Reserve than you are going to be interested in pissing on my chips. I reckon, in the grand scheme of things, I’m an irritating fly you’d be delighted to swat if you got the chance. But those two? I think taking a decent-sized shot at them is enough to make your socks roll up and down.”

“What a delightful way with metaphor you have,” Nuroon said. “And you think you may be the appropriate instrument by which I can ‘settle scores’ with the Mayor and the Warden, do you? You have an exceptionally high opinion of yourself, Inspector Lowe.”

“Yeah, well, I lodged myself pretty far up your sinuses, didn’t I? And, to be fair, I wasn’t even trying to annoy you. Imagine how irritating I’ll be with someone I’m actively aiming to piss off.” 

“Indeed.” Nuroon tapped his teeth thoughtfully. “Imagine. So, just humouring you for a moment. Am I to assume all of this is linked to the very mysterious events that occurred recently at the Vault?”

“Perhaps. But I guess that rather depends on what you know, doesn’t it?”

“Don’t push it, Inspector Lowe. You are on the thinnest of all the ice. Of course, it is clear that, since the Vault was compromised, a great deal of political maneuvering has occurred in the aftermath, and somehow, despite having no business being involved, you have once again waded in like an imbecile looking for a fight.”

“Look, Director. You must know why I’m here. Why don’t we skip the melodramatics? Why don’t you tell me what was stolen and I’ll get on with my day,” Lowe said, ignoring the barb. “You do know, don’t you?”

“And if I did? What is in it for me? Other than the opportunity to irritate some people who, to be honest, I’m fairly sure there are more subtle ways to make unhappy than aiming you at them. ”

“Fair enough. How about I trade for it? There must be something I can do for you? You give me the information I need and I’ll do something for you. Name it.” You could be reading stolen content. Head to the original site for the genuine story.

This was the part of the plan both Latham and Rook had been unhappy with.

“You don’t trade with a man like Grackle Nuroon,” Latham said. “Don’t you remember what I told you before?”

But Lowe didn’t think they had much choice. If it was dancing with this fucking spider or visiting Arkola, he knew which one he was happier with. Which said nothing good about the whole situation, now he came to think about it.

For a moment, silence stretched between them. Then Nuroon let out a slow, deliberate breath. “You truly have no other options, do you?”

“No. I really don’t.”

That seemed to amuse him. “Marvelous.”

“Director . . .”

“Fine.” Nuroon leaned back in his chair, eyes glittering in the firelight. “Yes, I think I know what was taken. But no, I will not be giving you that information for nothing.”

“Shocked. Shocked I am to my very Core.”

Nuroon considered him for a long moment before rising from his chair and moving toward a cabinet against the far wall. He unlocked it and pulled something from inside—a small, polished clay disk, barely the size of Lowe’s palm.

He moved back to his seat and set it down on the desk between them.

“This will show you what you need to see,” Nuroon said. “The device contains a memory. A firsthand account of what was placed in the Vault. You will experience it as if you were there which is, as I understand things, not unlike your own Grid View Skill.”

“And what’s the catch?”

"Several. Firstly, the memory is raw," Nuroon said. "It may not be an altogether pleasant experience. And, secondly, there is the small matter of payment."

He extended a hand—long fingers, dry as parchment, nails that might have been lacquered with old blood. "As I am sure you are aware from your own experiences with your Skill, this memory will not be like a story written on parchment, neat and ordered. This is a thing still bleeding. It has no edges, no structure, only sensation. You will not see it as a play upon a stage, nor as ink upon a page. You will feel it. And it will feel you in turn."

The air between them thickened. A ripple, as if something unseen had stirred. Nuroon's voice pressed on.

"Pain lingers in it. Pain and confusion. Not merely the pain of the one who lived it, but of the memory itself, forced from the place where it once belonged. A severed limb still aching for the body, as it were. It will writhe as it enters you. It may resist. Twist. Lash out. I have bound it as best I can within the disk, but some wounds refuse to close."

“Awesome. Sounds lovely. And what do you want in compensation for this little joy?”

Nuroon smiled, and it was the worst thing Lowe had seen all day. A day that had begun with him dying. “A favour to be collected at a time of my choosing. No questions asked.”

“No.”

“Oh, don’t be tiresome, Inspector,” Nuroon said. “This is my price. You take the memory, and in return, at some point in the future, when I call upon you, you will help me out. And you will oblige without question. For now, all I require is your solemn oath that you will come when I call. Funnily enough, despite our recent differences, I suspect you will actually keep your word if it is given.”

“Why would you need a favour from me? You don’t even like me.”

“Quite the understatement.”

“So why this?”

“Because,” Nuroon said, “I know your type, Inspector. You’re infuriatingly persistent. You dig. You claw. You find things you should not find. That is why you are here, no? Your recent actions on these grounds prove that you chase something to the ends of Soar. Although, on that occasion, we were not on the same side, on rare occasions, I am willing to note the traits you possess may prove useful to me. I am not, in may surprise you to know, overburdened with allies. It would . . . amuse me to have you on call, as it were.”

Lowe considered his options. He didn’t have many. If he walked away, he’d be back to chasing shadows, hoping the next lead wasn’t a corpse of someone he cared about in an alley. And dealing in the dark against a bunch of Shimmerskins would be a nightmare. He needed Nuroon to give him something. Or his next stop was going to be the Celestial Temple.

Still. Did he really want to be in Nuroon’s debt? “I’m not giving you an open-ended ‘favour’, Director.”

“Then you are not getting your information.”

Fuck. Lowe glared at Nuroon as the clock ticked away. Eventually, he reached for the clay disk. “Fine.”

 “Good boy.”

Lowe ignored that, picking up the clay artefact. It was strangely cold to the touch.

“Now, when you’re ready,” Nuroon said, settling back in his chair like a man who already knew the punchline to a joke only he found funny. “Place it against your forehead and let it take you where you need to go.”  

Lowe stared at the thing in his hand.  

It was small, smooth, and cold in a way that made no sense. It was like it had spent a century at the bottom of the ocean and never before caught the warmth of a human hand. He’d initially thought it was clay, but it was nothing like that. Nothing that made sense, anyway. The disk felt slick, almost wet, though his fingers touching it stayed dry. It pulsed unpleasantly in his palm.  

He swallowed against the sudden tightness in his throat. He knew he was about to do something profoundly stupid - Latham and Rook had both made that clear - but was too far gone now to stop himself. He’d been in this situation so many times before, hadn’t he? Different places, different stakes, for sure. But still the same bad decision wearing a new coat. But, hesitation was just another way to say you were afraid, and Lowe had never much cared for cowards.  

So he lifted it and pressed it against his forehead.  

And the world dropped out.  

Not like the floor giving way. No, this was meaner than that. Like a hook in his skull yanked him sideways, but his body wasn’t invited along for the ride. His stomach lurched, flipped itself inside out, then decided to take a vacation from reality altogether.  

Then something thick and wrong oozed into his thoughts, curling like smoke in a room with no doors. He had a moment’s panicked remembrance of the fire in Hel’s house, but then that experience was passing as the smoke whispered to him, though not in words. It was a dry scrape against his skull coupled to the sensation of fingers trailing too close to the soft places behind his eyes.  

The shriek of voices followed.  

Slick. Murmuring. Layered over each other like snakes winding through dry leaves. Some were laughing. Some were crying. A few just repeated the same garbled syllables over and over, like a broken record skipping on the edge of a nightmare.  

And beneath them all, something else. Watching.  

It saw him.  

Not the way a man saw another man. Not the way a predator watched prey.  

This was deeper. This was recognition.  

Lowe tried to pull back, but there was no escaping. His body became a suggestion, a rumour he had once believed in but had never really been part of. The only thing left of him was him - naked and alone - floating in the centre of something vast and open and wrong.  

A low, satisfied chuckle crawled up the back of his mind.  

And it wasn’t Nuroon.  

It wasn’t anyone he thought he knew.

And for the first time in a long, long time, Lowe felt properly afraid.

 

            







	***





                He was standing in the middle of a past version of the Vault.

The place looked largely the same as it had when he’d made his many, more mundane visits. Almost. But there was something about the atmosphere that seemed off. Lowe idly wondered if his most recent experience here was playing tricks on him? Adding a colour to this memory which, pre-slaughter, it might not have had? Lowe didn’t know enough about this sort of memory transfer to comment either way, really. 

But, regardless, the feeling in the Vault right now was wrong. 

People were moving around the lobby, clearly locking up for the night. There were no customers, just a bunch of clerks, assistants and low-level functionaries completing their tasks. He didn’t think he recognised any of them - either from his own past or from reading the reports on the bunch of employees who had been replaced by the Shimmerskins. 

He wondered how long ago this had been …

Then he had his answer as one of the women caught his eye for no reason other than the dress she wore. Ah. That trend.  It had burned fast and ugly, a brief, humiliating blip on the fashion radar before vanishing forever. 

Necro-Chic.  

For a few breath months, the wealthy and tasteless had decided that looking recently deceased was the height of sophistication. It was all high collars and trailing black lace. Corsetry so rigid it might creak. Layers of bone-white silk deliberately crumpled to mimic grave shrouds. Accessories had included pearl-trimmed mourning veils, jewelry fashioned after memento mori, even gloves that mimicked skeletal hands. The truly committed - as it smelt like this woman was - had doused themselves in perfume meant to evoke freshly turned soil and dying lilies.  

He remembered that, once, Arebella had worn something like it. Mocked it even as she bought it, stalking around his flat in a ridiculous floor-length number like a widow waiting to faint onto the nearest chaise lounge.  

"I look like I died dramatically in an opera house," she’d said.  

Lowe had agreed.  

And now here he was, seeing it again. Most importantly, though, it helped to give him a rough date for when he was. He must be in a Vault of just under six years ago. When all these people were still alive. Still here. Still moving through their evening like nothing was coming.   

Beyond contemporary fashion commentary, Lowe’s focus snapped back to what he was witnessing. Because the tempo of all the movement in the room had shifted. The quiet hum of end-of-day duties had been replaced by something  approaching frantic. Almost frenetic, Lowe thought. The workers were moving faster, their conversations moving beyond idle chit-chat and becoming more pointed. It looked like something had happened, and they weren’t just closing up for the night anymore.

It seemed a message had come through that they were expecting someone.  

Then came the knock.  

And it wasn’t a timid, excuse me, may I please come in? sort of knock. Nope. This was hearty, I have arrived knock with all sorts of authority weighted behind it. This was a knock that was expecting to be answered. 

It was a knock that boded.  

Then a voice - a touch muffled, but still very understandable - called through from the other side of the sealed door.

“Lead Clerk, please grant us access.”  

Lowe stiffened at those words and turned to look toward the counter just in time to see a figure emerge from behind it. And he thought knew that man.  

Jaron Whitlow.  

Lowe had read this man’s file. He had sifted through his past and examined every inch of his life after finding his body torn open like some grinning, hollowed-out puppet.  

In the current version of Soar, Whitlow might be dead, but right now, he was standing there, alive and well, reluctantly stepping forward to grant access to whoever was knocking. Lowe couldn’t help but find that weird and, for a moment, had an irrational instinct to want to warn the Lead Clark about his future prospects . . .

As if sensing Lowe’s worry for him, Whitlow hesitated on his way to the door. Just for a fraction of a second. There was a little flicker of something in his gait, but then the Lead Clerk squared his shoulders and moved to the Vault’s entrance, pressing his palm against a runeplate. As he did so, there was a burst of mana, and the massive locking mechanism disengaged with a deep, rolling thud.  

The Vault doors swung open.  

And, as Lowe had kind of anticipated, the Mayor of Soar walked in.

Considering the time gap, Lowe might have expected him to look a bit different from when he had, most recently, threatened all of his friends and family. But he didn’t. Even his clothes looked exactly the same, with not a wrinkle out of place. Someone was working some impressive Aesthetic Skills on this guy. 

The same couldn’t be said for the person who followed him in. So much so that it took a third and fourth look for Lowe to realise who it was. The intervening years had not been kind to the Warden of the Reserve. The man Lowe had visited the other morning was a slab of fat wrapped in too much flesh, with a sprinkling of gluttony on top. But here? Here he was a lean bundle of energy. While not being a fan of cod Psychology, Lowe imagined that a case might be made that whatever was about to happen, this guy had taken to comfort eating to get over it . . .  

And then came the Justicars.  

Lowe took a half-step back, instinctively, even though he knew—knew—that none of the six giant soldiers that came next could see him. As he watched, the Justicars piled into the Vault, flanking a chest between them, big, meaty hands gripping the thick iron handles.  

Lowe frowned. What was so important that the Mayor had exclusively chosen Tower of Law enforcers for tonight’s little escapade? It was hardly a secret that there was no love lost between the two major pseudo-military factions in Soar. The Justicars and the Temple Warders might have been on the same side in theory, but in practice, they were two rival arms of authority, forever jostling for primacy.  That the Mayor and Warden had chosen only Justicars to protect whatever they were bringing into the Vault said something. 

And it said it loudly.  

The Lead Clerk, Whitlow, cleared his throat, adopting the same tone of quiet professionalism that had, according to the file Lowe had read, pretty much defined his entire career. “Sir. Sirs. It is a pleasure to welcome you both to the Vault. I was not, erm, informed to expect a deposit this evening.”  

The Mayor made an easy gesture. “Well, you’d hardly expect us to make a delivery of this importance public, would you?” He took a step forward, glancing around the lobby as if assessing whether or not it met his standards. Apparently, it didn’t. “I would hope I do not need to explain to you that the fewer people who are aware of our arrival this evening, the better. The Warden has repeatedly assured me that the Vault is the most secure site in the whole of Soar. Is he correct in this?”  

It was phrased like a question. It clearly wasn’t one.  

“Of course, sir,” Whitlow said, guiding the newly arrived group to one of the secured storage chambers deeper inside the lobby.  He, as best as he could, trying to wave the rest of his team away and back to their duties. There was no doubt there was an awful lot of interest in this out-of-hours arrival. So much so, Lowe was amazed he hadn’t heard a whisper of this.

“Just for clarity,” the Mayor said, raising his voice as the rest of the employees began to disperse. “Should anyone feel the need to share the details of this little visit, the Council will ensure that both you and your entire family will be erased. The Warden assures me you have all given the appropriate Confidentiality Oaths. That is so, no?” he said, turning to look at Morholt.

Well, maybe not so amazed, then. Bloodline genocide tended to buy all sorts of silence.

The thin - soon to become very fat due to all the stress-eating - face of the Warden of Reserves blanched. “Indeed, sir. It is a prerequisite for all employees of Sovereign Bank who are transferred here to undertake the appropriate rituals. But such a thing is, of course, just a formality. There has never been any record of the Vault failing in its protections.”

“Which is, after all, why we are here, Aven, is it not?”

“Indeed.” Morholt gestured for Whitlow to continue. “Indeed it is.”

“We have several security options available,” the Lead Clerk said. He glanced nervously at the Justicars and the chest they were carrying. “Though I assume you may well have your own specifications?”  

“The strongest you possess,” the Mayor replied. “It is absolutely essential that what is within this chest is placed under impenetrable conditions. It will need to lie wholly undisturbed. This chest does not get looked at. It does not get examined. It does not get touched. Am I clear on this?”  

The Warden smiled, trying to dissipate some of the growing sense of doom.“What my colleague means to say is that discretion is paramount.”

The Mayor positively exploded at the word ‘colleague’. “No, what I mean Aven, is that if I even get the slightest hint that one of your fucking bean counters has taken a peek at what is in this chest I will firebomb this place so thoroughly not even your own gods will recognise you. That’s correct, colleague dearest, is it not?”

The Warden nodded and dipped into his pocket for a sweet to crunch. So it begins, thought Lowe.

In the awkward silence that followed, Whitlow led the group toward the rest of the inner chambers, passing through reinforced archways lined with ancient inscriptions. Lowe fell in behind them, unseen, slipping through a closing blastdoor just before it sealed behind them.  

The final room they reached - one behind a plethora of further protections - was small and lined with storage compartments reinforced with layers of mana sigils. Whitlow gestured towards one of the largest of these, a containment unit warded so heavily it was positively humming. “This would be the most powerful of our safes. I - well, actually - I don’t think we have ever had cause to make use of it. before The cost to maintain the wards is entirely prohibitive.”

“Fine. We’ll take this one,” the Mayor said.

Whitlow glanced at Morholt. 

“Don’t look at him,” the Mayor said. “He is not in charge here. I am. Are you questioning my creditworthiness?”

Morholt popped another sweet and gave a slow nod. “Please ensure the Mayor is granted every consideration.”

Without waiting for any further sign, the Justicars came forward and, lifting the chest easily, maneuvered it into place in front of the storage compartment.  Lowe thought he wanted to see what was inside that chest more than he had anything in his life..  The author's narrative has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.

Come on, open it.

But they didn’t. The chest remained locked as they pushed it into the safe.

Whitlow worked fast to lock the unit, hands moving with long practice, but - Lowe thought - there was something a touch uncertain about about him now. A tremor at the edges of his efficiency. A flicker of nerves in the way he checked and re-checked each sequence of motions, as though afraid that one misstep might unravel the entire security matrix.  

“The thing about personal storage,” he said, the words coming out in a rush, “is that it’s only as secure as the person holding it. People tend to think their inventories are inviolate—locked away. Untouchable—but that’s just because they haven’t run into the wrong kind of people. Yet. And let me tell you, gentlemen, as I think we all know, the wrong kind of people very much exist.”  

His voice had taken on a lecturing cadence, as though he were giving a prepared speech, trying to drown out his own anxiety with the comfort of something he knew very well. He gestured, activating the first layer of warding around the chest. The symbols carved into the containment unit flickered, burning bright as mana rushed in before sinking back into the material, reinforcing themselves in a spiral pattern.  

“Most assume an inventory is a perfect vault. A bag of holding but better. Entirely free from theft, looting, or prying hands. That’s true… to a certain extent. But we know that Classes exist with Skills that bypass those protections.” He glanced up as if expecting the Mayor or the Warden to argue, but neither did. So he pressed on. “Looters,” he continued, “can extract from inventories—sometimes with restrictions, sometimes without. Likewise, certain Rogue archetypes have Shadowfinger, a high-tier Skill that lets them reach into an opponent’s inventory so long as the person is stunned or in some other way incapacitated. Indeed, some with the Cursed Thief Class can bind themselves to another’s possessions and actually claim them outright. There are even Ritualists with blood mana Skills that let them strip a dying man of his stored goods before the body’s even cold.” His voice dropped. “And, of course, there are some who don’t even need you dead to take what they want.”  

The Warden made a noise at that, but Whitlow hurried on with his work, activating another ward. The sigil work snapped into place alongside all the others, locking in around the chest tighter.  

“This, however,” he said, gesturing toward the containment unit, “is different. This is true security. No inventory access. No Skills that can pull from it. And no curses that can leech it. Not even someone with the highest-ranked authority at the Bank itself will be able to override this lock once it’s set.”  He forced out a chuckle. It was dry. Too dry. “Why, even with all of us dead on the floor, any incursion would still not gain access to this compartment.”  

Lowe couldn’t help but think that was some of the most blatant jinxing he’d ever heard in his life. He wondered if, in his final moments, Whitlow had thought of those words and wished he hadn’t tempted fate quite so openly.

Lowe’s gaze flicked to the Mayor and Warden. If they were bothered about the doomful phrasing there, it didn’t show. The Warden shifted on his feet, crossing his arms tight over his chest, glancing toward the Justicars. The Mayor’s expression remained entirely unreadable.  

Whitlow, oblivious or too rattled to care, pushed on. “This is, without question, the most secure place in Soar.”  

His hands moved again, tracing a final set of patterns in the air, solidifying the last of the layered protections. The containment unit hummed as the mana shield completed.

“The access sigil for this unit will be attuned to both of you,” Whitlow said. “No one else, not even myself, will be able to open it without your say so.”  

But the Mayor still didn’t look satisfied, which Whitlow obviously noticed. “Is… is something not to your liking, sir?”  

“I am not sure, Lead Clerk. I am, after all, trusting this Vault with something entirely irreplaceable. Something that simply must not fall into the wrong hands. Tell me, if I were to, gods forbid, die, what would happen to this safe? Would it automatically be opened?”  

“No, not at all. If either of you were to pass, the compartment would, of course, remain keyed to the other. Should you both leave this world, well, there is no override. No backdoor access. Not even Council authority would be enough to break the binding once it was locked. We have a number of such safes within the Vault where the owner is no longer with us. None with this level of protection, of course, but the theory holds.”  

“What about a god?” the Mayor said.

Was it Lowe’s imagination, or did the memory . . . flicker at that?  

A strange sensation prickled at the back of his skull, not a sound exactly, but a pressure—something that resonated deep in his core. It was as if the marrow of the world itself had been disturbed. The light in the memory of the Vault didn’t dim, not really, but for a fraction of a second, it felt thinner. Like someone had purged all the air from the room. 

Like something vast had turned its attention here, just for the barest of heartbeat.  

The coldest of cold trickles ran down Lowe’s spine.  

Then the walls of the memory shivered, and its edges became wrong in a way he couldn’t quite place. It wasn’t a distortion of vision, nor a trick of the light or an inconsistency in the playback. He’d actually experienced all of those in Grid View before, especially when he was running low on mana. It was far deeper than that. A structural warping, as if reality itself had momentarily doubted what it was supposed to be.  

Then, the memory of the Vault reasserted itself. The echo of people solidified, and the moment continued.  

But Lowe thought something external to the clay disk had reached in and touched it. Or someone?

Whitlow didn’t seem to notice, but the Mayor definitely had. The Warden looked liked he’d shat himself, Lowe thought, but the Mayor was much calmer. Just a minute movement, a gentle shifting of weight, and a tightening at the corners of his mouth. That was the only sign that he, too, had felt something.  

“Why, look at the pair of balls on you,” Lowe said aloud, not that anyone heard him, of course. “A fucking god is glaring right at you and and you don’t even bat an eye lid.”

There was a pause, stretched too long.  

Then, Whitlow laughed. A short, nervous little sound, the kind that slipped out when a man wasn’t entirely in control of his faculties. He adjusted his cuffs, a pointless gesture that did nothing to hide the slight tremor in his fingers.  

“Ah. Well. Yes. That would—ah. That would be a different matter entirely.” He cleared his throat. “We’ve never tested our protections against a god…”  

Something moved in the air.  

Not a sound. Not a shift in temperature. Just a feeling. A slow, crawling awareness that something else was listening. Lowe felt it again—that strange weight. That sense of attention bending toward them. The walls of the memory pressed inward, distorting at the edges, as though the past itself was straining under the burden of an unseen force.  

“Humour me,” the Mayor said.  

Whitlow hesitated. His eyes darted toward the Warden, looking presumably for direction. The Warden’s expression was dark and thunderous, but after a moment, he nodded.  

Whitlow licked his lips, then spoke carefully. “It would, of course, be blasphemy for Sovereign Bank to create something a god could not access. There are treaties in place with those in the Celestial Temple that make that very clear.”  

Another flicker. Another epic ripple in the memory. Lowe wasn’t sure whether the interference was back then. Or now. Neither would exactly be a joy.  

“There are no dwellers from the Temple here,” the Mayor said, gesturing toward the Justicars. “You can speak freely. And, of course, there’s no need to harp on and on about the treaties. I signed all of them, for fuck’s sake.”  

The Lead Clerk had been rattled before, but this was different. This wasn’t just nerves. This was fear. He didn’t want to answer.  Not because of politics. Not because of bureaucracy. But because of what it meant.

“So answer me,” the Mayor said. “Will this Vault keep a god out?”  

“In theory… yes, sir.” Whitlow swallowed. “These protections were built against every known incursion. Mortal and otherwise. The sigils do not discriminate between man and beast. Between thief and—” he hesitated, voice dropping, “—and the divine.”  

Another ripple, and Lowe felt a migraine start at the base of his skull. One which Roll with the Punches was absolutely not going to touch. 

Whitlow clenched his hands. “Why, even if a god were to stand in this very room and demand entrance, the Vault would hold. It does not recognise divinity as authority above either you or the Warden.”  

“Of this you are certain?”  

“No, sir,” Whitlow said. “Because, as I said, we have never had cause to test it.”  

For a moment, everything was still. Then the room shuddered. Lowe’s vision blurred, his senses distorting, the whole world tipping sideways without moving at all. And just for a moment—so brief it might not have happened at all—he thought he heard something. A whisper. Not words. Not even sound.  

The memory . . . winced.  

Lowe felt it.  

Like the world itself had curled in on itself for an instant, retreating from something it shouldn’t have dared to exclude. Then it passed.  

Whitlow was clearly unsettled but was determined to pretend otherwise. “The Vault will hold,” he said. His voice didn’t shake, but something behind his eyes did.  Lowe wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince.

The light thickened even further. Lowe felt it pressing against him, like he was standing beneath something enormous, something vast enough that its presence bent almost all light around it. He wanted to move, to shake it off, but there was no he to move. In this memory, he didn’t have a body to command.  

Just the memory.  

And the moment.  

He saw it now—the tiny, almost imperceptible distortions in the Vault. The way the shape of the people weren’t quite crisp. How the light didn’t seem to behave properly around the Mayor. How the air seemed to hold the echo of something unspoken.  

Not words.  

Not sound.  

Just rage.  

The Warden’s jaw worked as he chowed down on another sweet. He turned back to Whitlow. “Yes, that’s all fine. Just lock the damn thing up so we can be on our way.”  

Whitlow jolted slightly like he’d forgotten there was anything left to do. “Yes, yes, of course.”  

His fingers twitched through the final sequence. The containment unit hummed as the final sigils locked into place.  

The moment passed.  

The pressure eased.  

The light returned to normal.  

“Good,” the Mayor murmured. His fingers tapped against his arm. “And, Lead Clerk . . .”  

Whitlow straightened as the Mayor’s voice dropped a fraction.  

“You will forget everything about this transaction. You never saw us here. You never handled this.”  

Whitlow hesitated.  That was a mistake.  A Justicar took a half-step forward. Not a threat. Not yet. Just… a shift.  

Whitlow swallowed. “Of—of course.”  

He turned quickly, adjusting the final sequence of the containment unit, as if trying to put distance between himself and the moment. Lowe caught the barest flicker of a glance. Uncertainty. Dread. The realisation that he had just agreed to something far deeper than he had anticipated.  

And something else.  

A seed of knowledge buried just beneath his expression.  Because despite the Warden’s warning—despite the demand to forget—Lowe knew.  

Whitlow wouldn’t stay quiet.  

Couldn’t.

The existence of this memory disk proved that.

And that inability was going to get him, and a whole lot of his colleagues, killed.

“Good,” the Mayor said. His fingers twitched at his side. “No one gets near this. No one. Especially not the Temple.”  

The Warden didn’t contradict the statement. He looked like a man who had just locked something away but wasn’t sure if that was enough.  

Lowe took a step forward, studying him, the way his fingers curled, the way his gaze flickered over the containment unit like he was already second-guessing the decision to leave it here at all.  

There was something in that box that terrified him.  

Then the Vault shuddered. Not in the way a place should—no tremor of stone, no groan of shifting foundations—but in a way that made no sense at all. Like something in the fabric of reality itself had tensed, twisted, and recoiled. The air turned thick, pressing against Lowe like unseen hands, and for one single, unbearable second, the memory seemed to… resist.

Then, the walls of the moment folded in on themselves. Crumpling like wet paper as all sound cracked and warped. The Mayor’s mouth moved, but his words stretched too long, slowing into something unrecognisable, the syllables twisting in his ears like they weren’t meant to be heard.  

Then the world ripped, and the Vault was gone.  

And Lowe was back in the Museum.  

The chair beneath him was solid. The fire in the hearth crackled low, and the scent of old books and burned wood filled his lungs. And, of course, Grackle Nuroon was watching him.  

The Director of the Museum sat with perfect stillness, one hand resting against his desk, the other steepled against his chin. His dark eyes, sharp and unreadable, studied Lowe like he was examining something extremely valuable. Or potentially useless. Certainly one of the two.

“Can I assume that you have what you need, Inspector?”  

Lowe’s head still felt like it was somewhere in the Vault, but he was here. He was here.  

“No. Not at all, actually.” He stood. “But at least now I have a proper question to ask. And, more importantly, who to ask it to.”  

Nuroon lifted a brow. “And what, pray, is that?”  

“I need to ask Arkola what the Mayor took from him.”

            







	***





                "It's just - not a few bells ago - we all agreed that going to chat to Soar's Supreme Being was not a card we wanted to play yet," Latham said, almost sprinting to keep up with Lowe. "What did that fucking spider say to you that has changed your mind?"  

Lowe didn’t pause as he bounded up the stairs outside the Celestial Temple two at a time. So much so that Latham, despite all the insane advantages of his Class, was struggling to keep up.  

Grackle Nuroon had shown Lowe exactly what he needed and, of course, no more. He’d provided just enough access to the puzzle pieces to lure him into doing something stupid, but nowhere near enough to actually be anything approaching helpful. It hardly needed any of Lowe’s 200 points in Intelligence to know that had certainly been the Director’s intention. Nuroon wasn’t the type to let slights go, and what Lowe had done to him during his investigation into the deaths of those Curators was more than just some little irritation. 

In fact, the more he thought of it, the whole ‘I’ll do you a solid, but then you’ll owe me a favour thing,’ was just so much bollocks. Sharing that memory with him had been Nuroon’s way of achieving revenge. It was clear that he thought that putting Lowe on the trail of whatever had been locked in the Vault six years ago was going to get Lowe killed.

It was pretty damn transparent, but that didn’t mean he was going to back away. That had never been in Lowe’s nature. And he supposed the Director was counting on that too.

Lowe reached the top of the steps, and two giant Temple Warders moved in unison, each stepping forward with all sorts of self-importance to block his path. They were imposing figures. Well, of course they were.. They were Temple Warders. Both were Level ?? and were clad in heavy ceremonial armour. While neither of them was quite built on Latham’s scale, any of them on their worse day would be more than enough to turn Lowe into a frothy meat paste.

"Oy! Hang on, twat!" one of them said, extending a hand toward Lowe’s shoulder in what was probably intended to be a an entirely unreasonable deterrent. Seeing the movement, Latham put on a final burst of speed to try to intervene; however, the second the man’s gauntlet made contact with the Inspector, Lowe’s manacle screamed, and the Warder’s entire body jerked as if struck by an invisible force. Then his feet left the ground for the briefest moment—just long enough for gravity to remember its job and reassert itself with vigour—before he went crashing backward, the Warder’s heavy form bouncing once, twice, and then rolling down the temple steps in a mess of polished metal and curses.  

"Fucking hell, little man! What did you do?!"  

The other Warder didn’t fuck around, manifesting a huge halberd in their hand and activated some sort of offensive Skill as he prepared to enforce all sorts of divine authority. Because that’s what the Warders were, after all. The enforcers of the gods’ will. And on the grounds of the Temple, when someone had been stupid enough to hurt one of their own? Well, that mandate to act was pretty much absolute.  

Or at least, it should have been . . .

Lowe stared up at the second Warder as the silver inlays across the Temple’s doors gleamed brighter, casting long, unnatural shadows across the stairway, forming the shape of a fist. Then, the sky overhead, clear just a moment ago, seemed to deepen into the colour of a vicious bruise. Clouds unfurled from nowhere like blood spilling endlessly into water. And then, into all that silence, came a voice.  

He shall pass.

Well, not a voice. It was the memory of a voice having spoken. And a pretty fucking memorable one. The remaining Warder stiffened, his knuckles whitening around his halberd. Lowe assumed that another message must have been delivered, for his mind only, because - casting the filthiest of glares Lowe’s way, he shuffled aside and then went down the steps to help his fallen comrade.

Latham muttered something uncomplimentary under his breath that Lowe chose to ignore as he kept moving forward, through the open gates and into the Celestial Temple itself. It appeared that Arkola was not against the idea of Lowe stopping by with his question to ask, which was . . . interesting. Lowe’s mind paused on that for a moment. Was it? It was terrifying, certainly. But interesting? Maybe.

Battling with an impending sense of doom, Lowe continued through the Celestial Temple’s lobby - he actually hadn’t been back here since the conclusion of the Gianna d’Avec case and certainly hadn’t missed it - and while his steps may have been steady, his thoughts were anything but. Then a portal stone loomed ahead of him, the one keyed to the First Floor. 

And up to Arkola.

The last time he had ventured there, quite a number of people had died for the mistakes he had made. And not just those who had deserved it—though they had died too—but others with no culpability at all. Innocent people who’d been caught in the undertow of his choices. People had died because of what he had thought. Because of all his  cleverness. Was he just about to cause the same thing again? 

Lowe had thought he’d had it all figured out back then. He’d convinced himself - despite the chaos unfolding around him - that he might actually have been the one in control. That the pieces were moving where he wanted and that he had outmaneuvered everyone. After everything that had happened in the year following his Classtration, he’d been delighted, hadn’t he, that he was still able to play the game with the kind of balls that made men into legends.  

But in the end, what had all that confidence earned him?

Blood everywhere. Arebella held hostage. And a dead ex-best friend.

A man who had betrayed him in ways apparently Lowe still didn’t completely understand.

The portal stone keyed to the First Floor was ahead of him, nestling in its pedestal. A ball of ancient mana waiting for him. Offering passage? Leading to a fresh disaster.  

Lowe’s steps began to slow as he approached it. Just because Arkola had extended the invitation—pop up and see me if you're stuck—didn’t mean he had to respond, did it? Certainly, a sane man absolutely wouldn’t go anywhere near this. What was it that Rook had said? "As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport."If you encounter this story on Amazon, note that it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.

He wasn’t wrong, was he? The gods didn’t care anything about them. Powerful things rarely did. They moved their pieces. Made their plays. Laughed at the ruins they left behind. And Lowe was about to walk right into the hands of the biggest player on the board. Again. 

But the difference between this and last time was simple. Last time, he’d thought he had some measure of control. This time, he thought he knew better. The Warden. The Mayor. The Director. The God. All these powerful people trying to direct where Lowe should be looking. He was fucked, wasn’t he?

“For fuck’s sake, little man!” Latham said. “Just wait up for a moment.”

Lowe looked back and gave a sad little smile. “Look, we both know I need to do this. We’re nowhere and people are trying to kill us. This could be our best chance to get something approaching answers.”

Latham caught Lowe by the arm. Not hard enough to hurt, but enough to pull him back. Lowe’s manacle immediately reacted and its response clearly hit Latham like an invisible tidal wave. The Pressure crashed against him, but the Temple Warder held on to Lowe’s arm, his stance widening as he resisted being thrown away. Lowe dismissed any thought of using the active aspect of the Skill on his friend, but the passive one continued to push back against the Temple Warder. No matter what might have been Lowe’s intention, though, the Shattered Grasp would not be restrained.

Deep grooves began etching into the stone beneath their feet. Thin at first. Then deeper. Then wider. With horror, Lowe watched as the clash between two massive opposing forces dragged down into the very foundations of the Temple floor. He thought that was some sort of metaphor for his life just there . . . 

A whole host of people suddenly stopped to watched. Temple scribes, worshippers, and even a few off-duty Warders froze where they stood, conversations stalling mid-word. The spectacle of two powerful, contradictory forces warring in real-time was not something anyone saw often. Well, not for long, anyway. But it certainly wasn’t something anyone wanted to see right in front of them.

Latham clearly couldn’t believe what was happening either, his grip locked tighter on the Inspector’s arm even as the passive power at Lowe’s wrist doubled up and tried to throw him away. For one appalling moment, he was tempted to press the Pressure at Latham. To spiral him away and force him to let go. But Lowe dismissed that thought. 

“Latham, you need to let go. I can’t control the power here. It’s going to . . .”

"Don’t tell me what it’s going to do. You need to think about what’s about to happen here, little man. I mean, really think."  

Lowe clenched his jaw. His own muscles ached under the push-pull strain - Roll with the Punches repairing all sorts of damage - as the relic fought to break free from his control. It wanted to push the Warder away. To utterly obliterate him. But Latham wasn’t for moving. Somehow, he seemed to have anchored himself to the Temple floor, and was more than holding his own in the struggle. Even so, Lowe recognised that he was pushing up against the full force of the Temple Warder’s will - a will forged to hold the line when gods themselves pressed against it. What the fuck did he have on his wrist here?  

He took a deep breath, trying to find a way to end the confrontation with both of them still in one piece. "I am thinking about it, Latham. But I need to know what’s happening now and, more importantly, I need more of a handle on what happened back then. Unless I go up there and ask Arkola, I’m never going to find out how the Temple is mixed up with the Black Knight. And, more important than that, why!" Lowe said. “This is the only way we’re ever going to find out what’s going on. I can’t waste the opportunity.”

The forces warring between them tightened. "Says you, little man!”

“Says me.”

“Lowe, I don’t know what’s going on here, but I don’t think you understand what you’re potentially walking into. If you ask a god for a favour, there’s going to be no way of wriggling free from that. And that goes triple. Quadruple with Arkola."  

The floor beneath them cracked and a long fissure split the stone where their feet dug in. The Pressure spiked and then, all at once, it broke. Latham’s grip snapped open, his hand recoiling as if burned. He took a sharp step back, his boots grinding against the now-ruined temple floor. He looked down at his hand, utterly amazed. “Lowe, listen to me. Really listen. It’s the first thing they tell you on day one, when you sign up to be a Warder. Every Temple has its gods, every god has its Avatar, and every single one of them is a fucking nightmare in their own way. They are not people. They are not saints. They are not mentors or oracles or kind, guiding hands to help us stand tall in this veil of tears. They are power wrapped in the idea of a person, and the moment you start thinking otherwise, you are already lost. If Arkola is the one who slipped you that -” he gestured at the manacle- “then nothing good is intended.”   

As Lowe said nothing, Latham pressed on. “You do not want this kind of help, nor this sort of attention if you can avoid it. You think you’re going up there to have a conversation? You’re not. You think a discussion with Arkola is just going to be another lead? It’s not. It’s a summons. A god - especially this god - doesn’t just invite you up there for a fucking chat! It doesn’t care if you’re confused, or stuck, or looking for answers. It wants something. And if Arkola wants something from you, then you are already a piece on the board, whether you like it or not. So, no matter what else, if you are planning to ask it for help . . .”  

Still, Lowe didn’t speak.  

“I don’t pretend to understand the shit you got tangled up in back before I met you, but I know this. You don’t get to come back from Arkola doing you a solid the same. You won’t be the same. Every Warder knows it. Every Priest who’s had so much as a glimpse of the First Floor knows it. You go up there, and ask for help and you are seen. And once you are seen—really seen—you do not get to step back into your life like nothing changed. You don’t get to be some bastard Inspector scuffing his boots through the underbelly of Soar, solving his cases, keeping his head down. You will not get to be Lowe anymore. Do you understand me?”  

“Mate, this is all a bit much. I’ve been up there before!” Lowe said.

“No. Not like this. There’s being in Arkola’s presence and then there’s being in Arkola’s presence. And don’t patronise me by telling me you don’t understand the difference. So, before you step through that portal, you need to ask yourself one question—do you really want Arkola to see you?”  

Lowe met Latham’s gaze. “I think,” he said, “it’s too late for that. We need answers.”  

Then he pulled free and stepped into the light.

And let the portal take him.

            







	***





                The world ended.

Or rather, it ceased to exist in any real way Lowe could comprehend. The reality of the Celestial Temple's halls. The torn and shattered marble under his boots. The weight of his coat around his shoulders. It was just all gone. And in its place, he was transported into a nothingness. There was no light. No dark. No air. No up or down. He couldn’t make any movements, because to do so would require space, and space required rules, and . . . 

Well, here and now - if there was a ‘now’ and ‘here’ in any way Lowe’s mind could still understand -  there were none.  

Lowe thought he could feel his pulse quicken and the dampness of sweat beading at the back of his neck, a cold trickle that shouldn't have been possible in a place without heat or gravity. That was a nice touch, Lowe thought. It appeared that his body still existed in some way here, but only - of course - because Arkola allowed it to be so. And his mind continued to  exist only because the god hadn't yet decided to peel it apart and examine all the things that made it up

Lowe had done this little dance before, but the performance hadn’t gotten any easier with repetition.

He resisted the temptation to look around, knowing that Arkola would be in this nothingness somewhere, but wouldn’t be in any form he could see. There were no shapes here - no clear outlines of markers - only the awful knowing of something vast and unbearable examining him from a vantage point he could never perceive. The similarity between the aura of the presence and what Lowe had felt display such anger within the memory Grackle Nuroon had showed him was undeniable.

Ah, so it us you again? the voice had said. Not through his ears. Not through any real sound at all, but more Lowe knowing, in retrospect, that he had been spoken to. In a blink, his mind had always contained the words, but was only now recognising it as a coherent message. The funny little Inspector who people keep punching in the face stands before me.

“Yeah. Guess I do. To be fair, though, you did tell me to come up and see you.”

The knowing pressed down again. Again, it was not words. Not even anything as ephemeral as concepts. But it contained some pretty heavy judgment. Then a hand rifled through his soul like it was a ledger and Lowe’s Core was thoroughly rummaged through. And all his sins were tallied. That took a bit longer than he might have hoped.

Then he was lifted. Not physically. It wasn’t like his body moved. There was no body, after all. But Lowe felt like he was grasped all the same. Plucked up like a coin between uncaring fingers and then flipped. Something tore him apart, piece by piece, weighing each of his thoughts. Examining all his regret. Every moment where he had made a choice and let it unfold into consequence was looked at and considered.

And then - just when Lowe thought he couldn’t bear it anymore - it put him back, with a quiet disdain.

“Was that as good for you as it was for me?” Lowe asked. “I usually would have a smoke right about now, if you have one handy?”

There was no laughter. Arkola had no laughter to give. But Lowe sensed that there might have been amusement - distant and impassable for sure - but still some sort of lop-sided grin. Maybe. 

You persist in your delightful irreverence. Even here. Even with me. Even now.

“Well, I suppose I have to get something out of this, don’t I?” Lowe said. “Otherwise, all this soul exposing just becomes a bit like a forced striptease.”

The silence stretched out between them. It wasn’t emptiness—it was impossible to be near Arkola and feel empty—but it was still a deep and abiding stillness. A withholding. Lowe knew better than to take that as permission to speak. He had not been granted that right yet. And he’d got that wrong before.

Finally, though, the world… shifted again. It was not a change Lowe saw in anything like visual terms, but suddenly, he felt that Arkola was looking at something else. Lowe could sense it, like the way a trapped mouse might feel a cat look away. A crack of light in an otherwise sealed tomb.

And then, impossibly, the sense of something else appeared. A form. An object.

It was not clear what it was at first. Just a weight in the space beside him. An idea given shape, perhaps. But then it became a . . . statue. Something small enough to hold in one hand. Certainly plenty small enough to keep locked away in a chest, for example. It looked like it was the representation of a bird with a broad chest and curved beak, its wings folded down against its sides. The material from which the statue was made was dark. Matte. Something between stone and metal, Lowe thought.

“You have got to be kidding me!” he said.

But there was no answer. He doubted there would be to that that sort of statement. Those as powerful as Arkola never seemed to feel the need to explain. They only showed and demanded.

“This is what the Mayor took?”

Yes.

“And I imagine that you would like it back, ever so much, please. If I would be so kind.”

A further silence. Lowe knew that ‘like’ was probably the wrong word there. Arkola had no ‘likes’ or ‘wants’ as Lowe would understand them. It did not desire. But it certainly required. 

It must be returned to me.

“Did I hear a ‘please’, there, mate?”

You dare to speak to me like that?

“I mean, I don’t know about that. This is your universe, after all. Do I dare? I imagine you can make it so I do or do not as you like. Must be nice having that sort of pull.”

It must be returned to me.Did you know this story is from Royal Road? Read the official version for free and support the author.

Lowe decided not to push things any further. “Okay, so you want the statue back. Received and understood. Do I at least get to know why he took it? The Mayor, I mean. Because it was him with the sticky fingers, wasn’t it? Six years back, the Mayor took something of yours and, for whatever reason, you can’t simply kill him and get it back, can you? My! I bet that really grinds your gears, doesn’t it? To be an ineffable, supreme being and have a jumped up little guttersnipe like the Mayor hold something over you? Bet that really pisses you off.”

This time, Lowe thought that the silence was different. It was heavier. Not stillness, but a thing closing down. A door not slammed, but deliberately being shut. No entrance. Lowe, who had never used the word ‘guttesnipe’ in his life before, wondered if he might possibly have taken things a bit far there.

I am afraid that you ask the wrong question.

“Do I?”

Yes. But that is to be understood and, if not accepted, then at least forgiven. You are , after all,forced to move through time. In a straight line. I, of course, am not.

That made sense, Lowe supposed. Something as trivial as time would mean nothing to Arkola. Cause and effect did not follow the same structure. The past. The future . . . it appeared to be able sift through them as easily as looking through pages in a book. It was said that if Arkola wanted, it could speak of things yet to come with the same certainty as things long since passed. It was no wonder it had made the First Floor its own. Hard to displace someone who, quite literally, could see you coming before you even got out of bed in the morning. It made Lowe wonder how the Mayor had managed to complete his little felony . . .

You know, Inspector, should you think to ask, I could tell you the identity of the Black Knight .

“I’m sure you could. But I guess it would all depend what it would cost me?”

Nothing. Everything. I actually do not know. The cost will, ultimately, depend on you.

Lowe swallowed down the bile rising in his throat. Then stopped. Funny that, when he wanted to, Arkola could ensure that he would have a gorge to rise. It was just that sort of manipulation that he absolutely could not stand. When the powerful in Soar would hold out a tasty morsel for the less privileged to grab hold of. It was how the world worked, he was told often enough. But that didn’t mean he had to play ball. “No, thank you. I reckon I’ll be able to sort that out myself. That’s not what we’re talking about right now.”

We are talking about all things.

Fury sparked, hot and tight in his chest. He took a step forward before remembering there was no ground to step on. Or anyone to move towards. “Don’t do that! Don’t play coy with me. If you want something from me, just come out with it and tell me what it is. Tell me what this damn bird is and who has is it. Don’t dangle rewards in front of me like I’m a baby bird. Just give me some straight fucking answers!”

Arkola moved. Not in a way Lowe could see, but in the way gravity shifts when a planet tilts. The world around him tilted.

It is what it has always been.

Lowe hated all this cryptic bullshit. The evasions wrapped in false clarity. But that was how things like Arkola worked, wasn’t it? If Lowe wanted an answer, he was going to need to ask just the right question.

“Just tell me! What is it, and how come the Mayor has his perfectly manicured nails all over it?”

Arkola did not answer.

Lowe growled and then thought of Whitlow sealing something within his Vault about which he had no idea. He thought of the Warden of the Reserve’s nerves. And the Mayor’s completely unshakable confidence. And the way he had made sure there was no Temple presence involved in its storage. 

What had happened six years ago? Had that been what sparked everything into motion? And what about the Black Knight? Why had he reappeared now? And how had he managed to steal something even Arkola hadn’t been able to access. That’s what made no fucking sense!

“This thing—” He gestured at the statue. The bird. The object that was not just an object. “Is it, I don’t know, dangerous to you in some manner?”

The pressure in the space changed. Arkola did not confirm. It did not deny. But that silence said everything.

“Right. Okay. So you need it back because . . .”

The weight of all of Arkola’s knowing suddenly pressed down on Lowe, its presence unbearable. 

You have been shown all that I am willing to show. But know this, return to me what has been taken, or all contracts between me and Soar will be null and void. I suffered the behaviour of that silly little man because his game was of no consequence. Now that the Cuckoo is free to call, that changes. I shall give you . . . a day. No. Let us make it two. I would not want to be judged precipitous and wrathful. At the end of the second day , the Temple - well, I - will take . . . action.

“Action?”

Lowe blinked, and the world was ash.  

The sky had turned white. Not the white of clouds nor light, but the bleached, pitiless void left when a thing is scoured down to nothing. The sun was a wound in the firmament, a black abscess bleeding heat, pouring ruin upon the city below. The air did not burn—it consumed, peeling flesh from bone before breath could turn to scream.  

Stone wept fire. The towers of Soar bowed their heads and crumbled, not in the slow dignity of time’s decay but in sudden, absolute surrender. But they did not fall. They were unmade. The streets split with a groan, their veins of mortar spilling red as the city hemorrhaged into the chasm yawning below. And that chasm . . . There was no molten glow. No depthless abyss. Only absence. An unshaped void that gaped wide to drink the ruin of man.  

Then came the sound. The dirge of a world betrayed by its own foundations. It rose, a vast throat clearing before speech. 

And the people. They ran, as ants might run from the shadow of a boot. But there was no escape. Their bodies lit like torches, blackening mid-stride, burning to silhouettes before wind could scatter their cinders. Some clutched their children, their limbs fused together in their final moments, a grotesque tableau of love and futility. Others did not even see the end coming, caught mid-word. Mid-thought. Mid-breath. Frozen statues of soot before the gale swept them into nothing.  

Still, the fire moved. 

It did not rage. It consumed. It rolled outward in a tide that left nothing behind, not ruin nor wreckage, only a vast and silent stillness where once there had been life.  

And then they came.  

Lowe saw them walk through the smoking bones of Soar—figures too thin and tall. They did not cast shadows, nor seem to move in any way a body should. Their shapes rippled, flickered, unmade themselves between one step and the next. They passed among the wreckage, untouched by the fire or the hunger in the sky. And where they trod, the last remnants of the city simply ceased to be.  

Then—nothing.  

Lowe gasped, and he was back. The world was unbroken. 

It had not been a warning.  

It had been a certainty. In the world of Arkola, it had already happened.

Then, Lowe was standing in the Celestial Temple again, the portal stone cooling in his hands. The pressure in the air had lessened, but had not disappeared entirely.

A whisper of suggestion curled through his mind.

Find it. Or else. If I am denied in this, Soar will burn.

Arkola did not demand. It did not threaten. It simply knew what would happen. What had happened.

“Little man?” Latham was at his side. “You okay?”

“Fuck no,” Lowe said.

“Did you get what you needed?”

“Absolutely not. But, on the plus side, it’s not like things have gotten worse.”

“Really?”

“No. Not really. They’re worse. So, so, so much worse. How quick do you think you can get me in to see the Mayor?”

            







	***





                “You can’t go in there . . .” 

“Bite me!” Lowe snapped, shoving past the Wereman at the Mayor’s front desk. Then, as the words caught up with his brain, he reconsidered. “Actually, don’t. I like my flowing locks just the way they are.” 

The Wereman gave him a look. A look which suggested he’d heard every possible variation of canine-related humor and found none of them either charming or amusing. Which was probably fair. Not many people chose a Class that left them sporting a permanent set of fangs, a thick pelt, and an inconvenient urge to chase passing carts. 

Most people, when selecting their Class, went for something practical. Something that came with useful perks, a solid career path, and, crucially, didn’t make them look like they lost a drunken bet with a wizard. 

Lowe thought he could count on the fingers of one dick the number of people he knew who had willingly chosen a Class that really altered what stared back at them from the mirror. There was Old Meryl from back when he was a kid, who’d taken Stonebound Archivist and slowly turned into something that looked like a cross between a librarian and a cathedral gargoyle. Then there had been the Headmaster at his school, the late, great Edgar Vance who’d picked Serpent Adept and had to spend the last years of his life with a tongue that wouldn’t stop flicking and a tendency to coil himself around his chair when concentrating. A regrettable decision, in retrospect, especially when he dozed off in assembly.

So, yes. People didn’t tend to go in for the kind of Class that required changes that left them unable to pass for ‘ordinary’ on a good day. People liked the idea of being monstrous more than they did the reality of it. And who could blame them? Try finding a barber who knew how to trim around spines, or a tailor who could accommodate extra limbs without sighing loudly and then charging double. This was Soar, after all.

But Weremen? Now, they were very different indeed. In Lowe’s experience, Weremen didn’t shy away from the crazy, they properly leaned into it. They enjoyed the whole look. The claws, the fur, the predatory smirk that made people rethink casual insults. Even the name of the Class itself was a pose. Because they weren’t werewolves, at all, actually. They weren’t bound by anything as mundane as the phases of the moon or some terrible, awful ancient curses. No, there was never any tragic, poetic transformation at dusk for these guys. They were just . . . Weremen. 

Because, as it turns out, some people really would choose to be seven feet of teeth and muscle if you let them. 

And right now, one of them was rising from behind his desk, very much considering whether Lowe’s flippancy was worth a . . . professional breach of acceptable conduct. 

Lowe held up his hands, as he carried on moving toward the Mayor’s door. “Look, let’s both pretend I came up with something less stupid and you glared me into silence, yeah?” 

The Wereman - he was called Norris, Lowe remembered - grunted, which Lowe took as both forgiveness and permission to shove open the office door before he could be ordered otherwise. Latham moved to accompany him, but Lowe held a hand up.

“No. Somehow, it seems the Temple is bound up in all of this. I think he’ll speak more freely with you out here.”

“Fuck’s sake, little man! We’re not going to get anywhere if you keep me at arm’s length like this!”

“Hey, if you want to feel all important, you make sure Hairy McLairy here doesn’t stop me leaving when the time comes.”

Norris growled. “You know, that sort of comment could be considered to be discriminatory . . .”

Lowe shut the door behind him, leaving Latham to argue the finer points of workplace banter. 

The Mayor’s office was exactly what Lowe expected—tasteful, expensive, and designed to convey authority in a way that was just this sign of the line of ‘mawkishly ostentatious.’ The Mayor himself was positioned behind a vast mahogany desk, fingers steepled, and with his perennial look of smug self-assurance. If Lowe did not know better, he’d say he was expected and this was all a careful poise.

"Inspector Lowe," the Mayor said, not bothering to stand. “How goes your hunt? Do you have news for me?"

"Not really. It’s been a bit of a day so far.”

“How do you mean?”

“Oh, you know. The usual. Attempted murder. Shimmerskins. A little light torture. Gods making threats. The oncoming end of the world. That sort of thing."

“Sounds busy.”

“Not really. Just another day in paradise.”

The Mayor smiled, but it had no warmth in it. "I see. And, if you are not here to announce success in the quest I set you, to which of those fine subjects do I owe your visit?"

Lowe paused. On the way over, he and Latham had discussed how to play this. The Mayor might not exactly be Arkola-powerful, but in the grand scheme of things, he was more than powerful enough. In Soar, you didn’t need to be able to control the nature of reality in order to truly fuck someone up. Enough gold could see you through most inconveniences. They’d not been able to come up with a foolproof plan, so Lowe just did what he did best. He led with his chin. "Arkola wants its statue back. The one of the little bird you locked away in the Vault six years ago. He says you’ve got two days to come up with the goods, or ‘all contracts will be void.’ I imagine you know what that might mean."

The Mayor didn’t so much as blink. He reached for a small silver letter opener, turning it idly between his fingers. "Is that so? I imagine it might have been quite forceful about the matter."

"Oh, you know how these things tend to go. Plenty of divine menace. Strong implication that if I fail, everything and everyone burns in hellfire. The usual."

"Mm. And so it would appear that you came straight to me to whinge about it. I have to say, I don’t quite understand all of the fuss. It sounds like Arkola has simply given you the same quest both I and the Warden have already placed at your feet. If I had known you’d required some extra motivation, I would been more explicit with my own threats. Time is ticking, Inspector Lowe."

Lowe let the silence develop until the Mayor sighed theatrically and set the letter opener down. "I imagine you have some very interesting theories about how I came into possession of this particular trinket."

"I actually don’t. But I know you put it in the Vault. Safe behind one hell of a deadman’s lock. Arkola knew you’d got it, but couldn’t do a fucking thing about it. Apparently, if it killed you and the Warden, it would never get it back."

“‘Or,’ actually.”

“I’m sorry?”

“The deadlock, as you call it. It was set to activate if Arkola killed me or the Warden.”

Lowe thought back to the memory Grackle Nuroon had shared with him. It was definitely ‘and’ and not ‘or’. The Mayor clearly saw the scepticism on the Lowe’s face. “That stupid little Lead Clerk fucked things up, didn’t he? Made it so the package was sealed behind a door that would permanently lock if either of us died. I tell you, Inspector, there is simply no one in this world you can trust to do their job properly. The stress that put on poor Morholt during all that unpleasantness last year.”

For a moment, Lowe wasn’t sure what the Mayor was talking about. Then it suddenly made sense. The Black Knight murders. “The Warden was terrified what would happen to him should you have proved to have been . . . the Knight’s next target. That Arkola would completely lose its shit should the Vault be sealed.”The story has been taken without consent; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.

And that wasn’t a wholly ridiculous assumption, Lowe thought. When the great and the good had started dropping like flies, they - Lowe’s squad - had been certain the Mayor was likely to be a key target. It still baffled him that the Black Knight hadn’t ever taken his shot. Yeah, with all those falling down dead, Lowe could see how Morholt would get . . . twitchy.

“But now the statue has been stolen and he’s equally twitchy the two of you don’t have any more collateral against Temple retribution. And he doesn’t even know about the upcoming end of the world yet.”

"That is an incredibly simplistic way to look at things, if I may so."

"Yeah, well, I’m feeling particularly simplistic right now."

"Do I presume you think I did the wrong thing?" the Mayor said. “In locking it away?”

"Not for me to say. Arkola, though? Arkola’s got all sorts of opinions about it. It’s pissed and I’m just the messenger."

The Mayor gave a short, amused laugh. "Ah, but messengers are so much more than that, aren’t they? After all, if you are not just messenger by a Knight Errant of your own. And if you fail to locate what is missing, it won’t just be Arkola that suffers, will it? It will be Soar itself."

“I mean, sure. I guess you can put the weight of all this on me, if you want. Although, not for nothing, the wanker who stole something valuable from a god probably had something to do with the approaching apocalypse too . . .”

The Mayor’s smile froze in place, although the rest of his face collapsed inwards. "Tell me, Inspector,” he pretty much spat out. “What do you remember of what Soar was like, back then?"

"Back when?"

"Six years ago."

Lowe was a touch thrown by what felt like a massive non-sequitur. He shrugged. "It was much the same as it is now."

The Mayor laughed, shaking his head. "Such arrogance! And when that is coming from me, you better believe that I know of which I speak. No, Inspector, Soar was not 'much the same as it is now' six years ago. I can only presume you think that is the case because you were comfortably insulated against the realities of the world."

That stung. Six years back... well, yes. Things had been going well in Lowe’s life. He was moving through the ranks of Cuckoo House, breaking cases and earning himself quite a reputation. Things had been going well with Arabella—he’d actually been contemplating buying a ring, hadn’t he? And, what was more, he’d never heard of the Black fucking Knight. And he didn’t know anyone who’d ever been Classtrated. All in all, it had been a much simpler time. But ‘comfortably insulated?’ That felt a touch harsh.

The Mayor smiled, seeing the flicker of irritation cross Lowe’s face. "Well, let me tell you, Inspector, the reality for those with less advanced Classes than you were blessed with was brutal. Gods did not want anything to do with them, you see. They simply wouldn't be their patrons. Sure, for those of us with 'interesting' Classes, we were fine. Golden, in fact. We had all the thresholds rewards we might possibly ever want. But how about the humble Street Cleaners? The Care Workers? What god was interested in caring for them? None I tell you."

Lowe tried to remember back. Had that really been the case? He was ashamed to admit that he didn’t actually know.

"So what changed?"

"I changed it!" The Mayor was suddenly standing, voice loud. Norris poked his snout through the door.

"Get out!" the Mayor yelled, picking up and throwing the letter opener towards the door. “I changed it. Me! I saw what needed to be done, and I did it. For the good of Soar.” 

“How unusually . . . altruistic of you, sir.”

“Fuck you, Inspector. Although, on reflection, I suppose you may be right. I certainly didn’t take on a god for the poor and downtrodden of Soar. There are only so many elections a man can ever win and Arkola has the longest of memories. No, I did it for everyone. Everyone who was ever forced into a Class they didn’t want. Every second son of an aristocrat that was lumbered with a ‘profession’ in order to be able to make their way in the world. Everyone with deep pockets who wasn’t as lucky as you, Inspector. You would be amazed at the number of people in Jewel Town who suddenly became very, very grateful to me.”

Lowe took a moment to process that. "Sorry, just to be clear, you blackmailed Arkola? For gold?"

The Mayor paused, before moving to his window and taking several deep breaths. When he turned around his expression had completely smoothed out into something far more composed. If Lowe hadn’t been there for that loss of control, he might think it had never happened. "I wouldn’t describe it as anything as crude as that. Morholt and I merely identified an opportunity and then let the Temple know that, as long pressure was put on all gods to recognise the value of patronising all Classes, I would ensure that the artefact that had . . . dropped in my lap would be kept very safe. And when that worked, as you would imagine, the gratitude from certain quarters was … most gratifying." The Mayor frowned, fingers twitching in the air as if feeling out invisible thread. “It’s so strange,” he said. “I do not seem able to get a read on you at all. Is it true what I’ve heard? That you have found a way around the restriction the Council placed on your build?”

“Oh, is that what the tickling sensation is?” Lowe said. “You’re trying to fumble around inside my mind. I thought it was indigestion.” 

He let all the Pressure go that had been accumulating around his chest everytime the Mayor had used a mental Skill to try and probe him. In response, the Mayor went flying across the room, landing hard on his backside with a strangled wheeze.

In seconds, though, the Mayor had struggled up onto his feet again. “Do you know what I can do to you for that! Classtrated would the least of it!”

“Is it worse than what you’ve already threatened me with?” Lowe asked. “Or worse than what Arkola is going to do in two days if I don’t get its statue back? See, you need to be careful with that sort of threatened escalation. If you’ve already said you’re going to kill my friends and family if I don’t find this statue for you, the stakes are already pretty fucking high. So, just so we’re all nice and clear, if you try to dig around in my head again, I’m definitely going to kill you.”

The Mayor opened his mouth and then closed it. A flush crept up his cheeks, but he didn’t say anything more.

“Okay, now that fun little diversion is over, here are my big questions,” Lowe said. “You need to tell me what is so important about this fucking statue. Why was simply having it enough collateral for you to be able to blackmail Arkola? And why has it been stolen from the Vault? And why is that enough for the destruction of Soar to suddenly be on the table?” 

The Mayor hesitated and then dusted himself off. “They may be the big questions, Inspector. But they are not questions I know the answers to.”

“Fuck off you don’t know!”

“Believe me or don’t, but what I say is the truth. Obviously, I know that the statue is important to Arkola. But I do not know why.” The Mayor rubbed his chest where Lowe’s retaliatory Pressure had struck him. “I came in one morning, and there it was. Sat on my desk with a note around its neck. ‘The First Floor will do anything to regain this. Do with it what you will.’ I thought it was all a joke. I made a comment about it in passing to a Priest and, well, you would think the world came crashing down. So, I spoke to the Warden and we made our play and after Arkola came through - as soon as everyone gained a patron god - I didn’t need to know why it was, but I certainly knew how valuable that fucking statue really was. Which is why I need it back in the safekeeping in the Vault as soon as possible. And not just to avoid Arkola destroying Soar. But to keep things the way they are.”

That wasn’t the winning argument the Mayor obviously thought it was. Things staying the same in Soar sounded fucking terrible to Lowe.

“What Skill are you trying to use on me?” Lowe said suddenly.. “You don’t have any Mental Skills logged with the Council as far as I am aware.”

“The amount of things of which you are not aware, Inspector, could stun a rampaging Minotaur. And I don’t think you are really in a position to talk about having access to Skills you shouldn’t . . .”

“Fair enough. Let’s put a pin in that one. Who sent you the package containing your collateral?"

Another sudden change of topic clearly took the Mayor by surprise. He went to answer, then stopped himself just in time.

“Fuck’s sake, sir!” Lowe said. “I’m flattered that everyone seems to have this high opinion of my ability to recover this statue - the Warden. You. Arkola - but if I don’t get anything to go on, then Soar is going to get flattened in two days' time. It strikes me that if a thing has gone missing, then the last person who nicked it is likely to be a good first point of all. But that’s just the opinion of a fucking Cuckoo House Inspector. What do I know? Who was it, sir? Who sent you the fucking statue?”

"The Black Knight."

The answer was so unexpected that Lowe thought he must have misheard. “I’m sorry, what?”

“The name on the package that I found on my desk six years ago was from someone calling himself the Black Knight. And under that message was a single line of poetry. "The king is lost, and shadows claim the board."

            







	***





                “You’re telling me the Black Knight is the one who gave you the statue?"  

“That’s exactly what I’m telling you.”  

"The Black Knight!" Lowe repeated, unable to stop himself. "The serial killer who haunted Soar—who hunted it—murdering, let me remind you, a whole host of people you were supposed to be friends with! Lords, merchants, high priests, Council members. People who, I was repeatedly told, mattered. And now you're telling me the collateral you used to put a fucking god in a chokehold came straight from them?"  

“I am aware of the history of the Black Knight, Inspector,” the Mayor said. “But do keep in mind that this was six years ago. Well before you and the rest of Cuckoo House failed, time and time again, to capture the person slaughtering the great and the good of Soar. I had no reason not to assume this was simply a gift from an appreciative constituent.”  

Annoyingly, that was a fair point. Six years ago was a long time before the murders. The first of them, anyway.  

"But you just... took it? No questions asked? Not even a why me?"  

"Inspector, I don’t know how things work in your world, but in mine, when someone offers you a gift that can change the world, you don’t ask frivolous questions. You accept it. Gladly. And then you pray it doesn’t come with too high a price."  

Lowe couldn’t help but think that the best time to count the teeth of gift horses was before you stuck your whole arm in their mouths. "And what was the price the Black Knight demanded, sir?"  

“You see, that’s just the thing.” The Mayor said. “He’s actually never asked me for anything.”  

Bullshit. Lowe didn’t need Arebella sat next to him to know a lie when he heard one, even if it was wrapped up in a politician’s trick of technically being true. Maybe the Black Knight hadn’t asked, but that didn’t mean he hadn’t taken. 

And, Lowe thought, it didn’t mean the bill wasn’t still to come due. 

That made Lowe think about the deal he had made with Grackle Nuroon for access to that memory. Maybe the Mayor wasn’t the only one in this office to make stupid pacts. "But why you, sir?" he asked.  

The Mayor’s lips twitched in something close to amusement. "Perhaps he saw something in me. Potential. A shared vision. Or perhaps he simply knew I was the only one who had the balls to do what needed to be done. But, let me be clear, Inspector Lowe. I am ordering you now to let me to worry about handling Arkola," the Mayor said. His voice had cooled, any pretense of affability stripped away. "It is for you to focus on doing your job. Two days, Inspector. Apparently that’s all the time you have to recover that statue. And, when you do - and I have no doubt that you will - you will make sure you return it to me, and not to Arkola. I’d make more threats, but I think I’ve already got that covered, right? You bring me the statue, and I’ll take care of the god’s temper tantrum. Me. Just like I have done so before. Now, I think this is the point where I will tell you to get the fuck out of my office."  

Lowe held his gaze. He wanted to argue. Wanted to demand answers, push further until something, anything, cracked. But he knew it was pointless. The Mayor wasn’t going to give him anything more. Not even if Soar was burning around him. Some people were just constitutionally incapable of playing it straight. So instead he stood, smoothed down his coat, and walked through the door.  

As he stepped out, the soft click of the door shutting behind him felt oddly final. As if something had just been decided, and probably not in his favour. Lowe assumed Arkola had been watching and wondered what it made of the conversation.

But he didn’t have time to brood on that, as half a second after re-entering the reception area, he noticed it had developed quite an atmosphere. The type you got when two people had spent a while not quite trying to kill each other but were definitely working their way up to it. Latham stood stiff-backed, hands on hips, face set in the deeply unimpressed expression of a man who had been arguing with a brick wall and resented the brick wall for not having the decency to get bored first. Opposite him was Norris and the Wereman’s fur was standing up along the back of his neck bristled, his claws flexing at his sides.  

“Fuck’s sake! Are you both still doing this?”  

Latham didn’t look away from Norris. “That depends. Does the little lapdog here still think he can stop us from leaving?”  

“I have a duty to ensure the security of this office,” the Wereman said.

“You also have a duty to remember that, when I do report this, I’ll be doing it directly to the Council,” Latham shot back. “So, by all means, try me. Pup. Level Forty Three? Are you fucking kidding me stepping up like this?”  

Norris’s hackles raised another fraction, and Lowe decided that, entertaining as the inevitable results of this particular clash might be, he had places to be that weren’t here.  

“Okay, okay,” he said, stepping between them before any bloodshed (or, more likely, paperwork) became necessary. He gestured towards the door. “We’re leaving, he’s staying, and we all get to go home in one piece.”  

A long, charged pause. Then, with great reluctance, Norris let out a low growl, stepped back behind his desk, and deliberately flicked open a ledger with a single claw.  

Latham strode past him, and Lowe followed, letting out a sigh of relief as the doors swung shut behind them.  

The cool evening air hit like a splash of water to the face. The manalights of Soar all flickered to life, the streets stretching ahead, teeming with people moving through the city’s arteries, oblivious to the noose tightening around them. Oblivious that the game was already in motion.  

The Black Knight. The statue. Arkola. The Mayor. Shimmerskins.  

It was all connected. But how?

Two days.

That was all he had.  

***

“And you still haven’t heard anything from the mistress?” Mylaf asked, putting two very different dinner plates down in front of Lowe and Latham. 

Latham eyed the heaving plate of fried food in front of him like a man about to propose marriage. The platter was a masterpiece. Golden, crispy and glistening with oil that had seen things, survived multiple fryers, and come out fighting for its life. Beside it, Lowe’s green leaf salad sat looking like it had lost a fight with a lawnmower and never quite recovered.

Lowe prodded a wilted bit of green with his fork. “I want you to know how much I hate you right now,” he said, watching Latham gleefully dunk something battered into something gooey.  

Latham grinned, chewing happily. “You hate yourself more, though, don’t you?”  

“I really do.”

“I’m sorry, sir, but Mr Latham needs the calories,” Mylaf said, setting down a tankard next to Latham’s plate with a thud. “His Skills burn fat for Stamina. Yours… don’t.”  

“And I suppose my meal was carefully chosen for maximum nutritional value?”  

“I’m not having Arebella get back and find that none of your suits fit.”  

Lowe slumped back in his chair, making a point of looking as tragic as possible. “You know, there was a time I thought you liked me.”  

Latham nearly choked on a fried mushroom, shaking with silent laughter. Lowe turned his fork over in his hand, watching a thin strand of something suspiciously healthy droop over the edge. “So this is where my life is at,” he muttered. “A world-ending conspiracy, a serial killer playing games from beyond the grave, and yet it is my waistline which is the key focus of discussion.”  

“The mistress?” Mylaf prompted again.

“No, nothing,” Lowe said. “You had anything from Hel?”

“No, but that’s hardly a surprise. Hel’s a pro. If she’s gone to ground, then she’s gone low. We’ll hear from her when she’s ready to be in touch with us.” Another wodge of fried food vanished. “Look, I’m loving your White Knight energy right now, but between you, me and the garden post, you’re literally the weakest link in our chain. A bunch of Shimmerskins attacked us, and you’re the only one they dropped. Your girlfriend is a walking lie-detector. Mine is, quite possibly, the scariest person I’ve ever met, and that’s saying something. Add in a fucking Auditor and a Druid and I think they’re probably set. Of all of us,  you’re the one most likely person to be splattered. Again. Which is why I’m staying here until we wrap this all up. Or until the world ends in two days. One of the two.” Latham looked at Lowe, who had gone entirely pale, dropping his fork onto his untouched salad. “What is it?”Support the author by searching for the original publication of this novel.

But Lowe had long ago stopped listening. 

White Knight. 

With just those two words, Latham had transported him back to just over a year ago. To a conversation where, after some of the revelations of the last couple of days had started to make a whole lot more sense.

***The chessboard was older than Lowe. Possibly older than Soar itself, if you believed Cenorth. The Commander said it had been his for decades, the edges of the wooden squares softened from years of use, and the pieces smooth as river stones from their constant handling. 

Although Cenrorth was pretty good at it, Lowe suspected his friend tended to use the game less for developing his skill levels and more about developing patience. Lowe’s, mostly.

The Commander sat across from him, posture impossibly relaxed. Especially considering all that was going on in the rest of Cuckoo House. A major operation to capture the Black Knight was in play - an entire park was being, subtly, ringfenced - and the boss and his Golden Boy, the man with the plan, weren’t doing anything more than playing chess! Lowe knew it must look ridiculous, but right now, he didn’t care. He needed help to focus, and Cenorth’s proposed game was just what was required. 

The game was only a few moves old, and despite Lowe’s attempt to dictate the tempo, Cenorth’s knight-heavy defence already meant he was feeling the pressure. After a moment’s thought, he brought out his own queen’s knight to try and push an attack on Cenorth’s developing central structure. “You’re playing aggressive today, boss,” he said.

Cenorth responded instantly, sliding his knight to meet the attack head-on. “As I’ve always told you, Jana, aggression isn’t always a bad thing. In certain circumstances, especially when the heat is on, it might be the only real option open to you. Of course, though, it’s a question of whether you’ve accounted for the consequences.”

Lowe tried to block out the chatter. Cenorth always talked like this when they played. Like he was discussing the game and not discussing it at the same time. It was the same with the case, he supposed. The Black Knight had taken Highberg’s child, and it was time to be aggressive in response. 

They had a plan. His plan. And that plan should work. The plan had to work. And yet, rather than helping with the final preparations, here they were, playing chess.

Lowe pushed a pawn to attack one of the knights. Cenorth barely paused before lifting it and tucking it safely back in cover, preserving the shape of his defence. “You don’t like knights, do you?” Cenorth said. “You seem to spend an inordinate amount of time and energy trying to push them back. Time you could spend actually getting on with things and building your own attack.”

Lowe reached for a piece, then stopped, realising too late that moving his bishop would be a mistake. He hesitated, wishing he could redo that action. Seeing his frustration, Cenorth shook his head. “This is your constant problem, Jana! What do I always say? Indecision will cost you the game faster than aggression ever will.”

Lowe grimaced, and then moved the bishop anyway, trying to pin Cenorth’s knight against his queen. Cenorth, unimpressed, immediately moved it to the side. Lowe forced the exchange with his queen, but his attack was poorly planned, and the turn he had to waste repositioning was going to cost him.

Which was when Cenorth’s knights started to dance.

He swung the one from left to right to guard his centre. Then, after Lowe castled kingside, he moved the other knight forward to take a central spot Lowe had carelessly given away. Lowe tried to push him back, but Cenorth responded more aggressively than Lowe thought he’d ever seen him, and after a series of trades, Lowe realised—too late—he had no answer for what was coming.

One of his knights attacked Lowe’s king’s position. Lowe, rattled, tried to kick it, but Cenorth simply shifted his other knight, covering everything he might have planned. Lowe pushed another pawn forward, trying to hold back the tide, but it was obvious the game was pretty much over

“Knights are at their best when working together, Jana,” he said, something odd in his tone that, even back then, had seemed strange. “A knight alone is a nuisance. A useful nuisance, for sure, but nothing more than that. But two knights, working together? Well, they’ll take your board apart before you even realise what’s happening.”

Lowe frowned. That was a little too close to the thing that had been gnawing at him all evening. He barely registered the next move as Cenorth's knight came forward for check. Lowe moved his king out of danger, but the board was collapsing around him. Cenorth repositioned his remaining knight to prepare for the coup de grace. “You see, you’re spending much too long thinking about the immediate threats,” he continued. “Which is admirable. It means you care. But if you care too much, you will end up missing the bigger picture. The key to this game - to life, really - is in knowing that pawns exist to be sacrificed. That’s the only reason they’re on the board in the first place.”

Lowe looked down and realised—too late—how much trouble he was in. He shuffled his rook into a blocking position, but Cenorth’s pieces were already where they needed to be. Lowe saw the mate incoming a second before it hit. His king was boxed in, the exit squares eaten by his own pawns. The knights’ movements had looked superficially scattered—but together, they had cut off every route to safety, shifting one step ahead of his defence each time. There was no escape.

Lowe reached forward and tipped his king onto its side.

They looked at each other for a moment, and then Cenorth reached forward to pick up Lowe’s white knight and turned it between his fingers as if examining its shape. 

“I assume this is the part where you tell me what I should’ve done differently,” Lowe said.

“Oh, I wouldn’t want to patronise you, Jana. You’ve played the whole thing exactly how I thought you would. The only way in which you know how.” Cenorth gestured to the toppled king. “You like playing the white pieces, don’t you?” 

“Most people do.” 

“Most people do, indeed,” Cenorth echoed. “Because white moves first. Because white acts, and then black has to react. Because, in the stories, the white knight is the hero, and the black knight is the villain, right?” His fingers continued to brush over the knight, and then he tapped it against the board. “But in chess, and in life, white doesn’t always win.” 

“Certainly not if you play like me, no!” Lowe said, trying to raise a mood that seemed to have become a bit dark. 

Cenorth moved the knight back to its starting position. “I need to ask you something, Jana. If you were playing a game, and the board was full of Black Knights… what would you do?” 

“Well, that’s kind of how it feels right now, boss, to be honest.” Lowe pushed away from the table and stood. “Look, if you don’t mind, I should run over a few last details for this operation with the boys.”

“You are not excused. Tell me, what would you do if you came across a whole board of Black Knights?”

Lowe frowned, unsure where this was going. “I’d try to take them off the board, I guess. Mind you, one of them is bad enough. No idea how I’d deal with an army of them.” 

Cenorth shook his head, face oddly sombre. "It would, ironically, be easier than just taking on one of them. An army of Black Knights would be chaos. You see, knights - those of both colours - are rather unpredictable. It turns out they are hard to contain. Dangerous, even to the ones who put them in play in the first place." 

Lowe wasn't sure where this was going and said so much. "What’s your point, boss? Look, I should be getting back to my team. We can pick this up after we’ve got the bastard. Drinks on me!" He expected Cenorth to stand, but he didn’t. 

"I’m just saying, Jana, that sometimes, the very worst way to take on black knights… is by being a white knight.” He stared up at Lowe. “There are other options available. If you want to take advantage of them." 

Lowe’s mind was already on Goldleaf Park. On the operation that was about to take place. “Right. Well, I appreciate the pep talk, boss, but I think I’ll stick to doing things my way. I think you’ll find all of this will be over and done with coming the night.” 

Cenorth studied him for a moment. Lowe sensed he’d let him down in some way. “Of course, Jana. Don’t let me hold you up any further. After all, as you said, you always play white.” 

Lowe had left the game thinking he'd just been schooled in chess. But looking back now, knowing some of the things Cenorth had been up to, he realised he was wrong. 

White Knight. 

Cenorth hadn’t just been idly chatting chess when he’d called him that. He’d said it as if it meant something. As if it meant something specific to him. And then, not two bells after this conversation, Lowe’s team was dead, they’d found the body of Highberg’s kid, and he was on his way to be Classtrated.

Knights are unpredictable. Hard to contain. Dangerous, even to the ones who put them in play. 

Cenorth hadn’t been speaking metaphorically, had he?

He had a very particular Black Knight in mind! He had known. That fucker had known who the Black Knight was and he’d been feeling Lowe out during this chess game, trying to offer him some sort of alliance. Not out of trust. Not even out of necessity. But out of sheer, cold-blooded calculus. Because, apparently Cenorth had read the runes and decided that the clash between Lowe and the Black Knight was a variable he couldn’t predict.

Had the boss betrayed the Goldleaf Park operation?

Of course he had! That was what he’d been doing all along, wasn’t it? Not helping with the pursuit. Not trying to support Lowe in bringing the Black Knight down. He'd been fucking directing the killer’s work.

Cenorth had sold them out that day, but not before he’d made some sort of strange, cack-handed attempt to recruit Lowe to his side. One he’d not even realised was being made. If he’d known what was being hinted to him back then . . . If he’d recognised that the boss he’d looked up to was something very different, would all of his friends still be alive? 

Latham, mid-bite, frowned. “What’s with the face, little man? You look like you’ve just realised your life is a tragic joke.” 

“Not quite. But I think… I think I’m finally realising what game I was playing.” 

            







	***





                “Fuck off, Lowe. Just fuck off. If you think I’m going to put my whole fucking face in the middle of this fucking clusterfuck, you’ve gone completely out of your fucking mind. 

"Do you even fucking hear yourself? You’re standing in my fucking office, with your fucking scruffy-ass face, asking me—me, of all fucking people—to go down to Restricted Records to dig up Cenorth’s fucking HR file like I’m some fucking intern looking to get a gold fucking star in treason. Like I don’t know exactly how that particular fucking suicide mission is going to end up. Like I don’t have enough actual fucking problems to deal with in this city, without your dumb fucking ‘theories’ adding another to the pile. 

"No, don’t you dare try to interrupt me, you fucking wanker.. I run Cuckoo House. I deal with shit on a level you can’t even fucking comprehend. I have Priests knocking down my fucking door all hours of the day, the fucking Council breathing down my neck, and enough fucking paperwork to build a fucking bonfire out of all the reasons I should’ve stayed retired. And now you—who is, let’s be real, only marginally fucking competent on a good day—are standing here asking me to personally sign my own fucking death warrant just so you can satisfy your fucking curiosity? 

"No. Fuck that. Fuck you. And fuck whatever fucked-up little paranoid delusion is rattling around in that fucking dented skull of yours. 

"Because let me tell you something about Cenorth’s fucking file. It’s not a file, Lowe. It’s a fucking black hole. It’s a fucking abyss with a department number stamped on the front. It’s a fuck-you written in official ink, tied up in so many redacted fucking layers you’d need a fucking war crime tribunal just to get a glimpse of his actual record. 

"And you think I’m gonna be the dumb fuck who goes in there, typing my nice little fucking clearance codes, knocking politely on the fucking Restricted Records door? You think I’m going to be the one who triggers every fucking alarm from here to whatever backroom cabal actually pulls this city’s strings? No, Lowe. No fucking way. Because I like my fucking job. And more importantly, I fucking like not getting fucking disappeared into a ditch. 

"So let me spell it out, real slow, using small fucking words. I Am. Not. Fucking. Doing. This. You want to die? Fine. Go do it on your own fucking time. But you don’t fucking drag me down with you, you absolute fucking lunatic. 

"And if you have any fucking brain cells left, you’ll let this entire fucking thing go. Because if the people who kept Cenorth’s leash even suspect you’re sniffing around again? There won’t even be a fucking body left for me to identify.”

***

Lowe dropped the file down on his kitchen table.

“She gave it to you?” Rook said. “Happily?”

“I wouldn’t say ‘happily’,” Lowe replied. “But the thing you have to remember with the Pernille Staffen is . . .”

“Her bark’s worse than her bite?” Mylaf finished.

“Oh my word, no. Her ‘bite’ is a million times worse than her ‘bark.’” Lowe said. “She has more registered kills than any Guardian of the Wall in Soar history. One of the medals she has on the wall is for slaying a Kraken, and I don’t believe they give those out just because you saw off a particularly inquisitive octopus. No, what I was going to say is that if there’s one thing she hates worse than, well, me, it’s the idea that someone in Cuckoo House was dirty.”

“And she’s that pissed off at a dead ex-Commander for being on the take that she’s willing to risk pulling down all sorts of shit on her head?” Latham said, and then whistled. “Actually, tell you what, how about we trade her in for you? If we have to have someone from the Security Services on our team, the certifiable badass legend with an incredible sense of duty trumps . . . well, the guy who won’t be much use in a scrap, but will probably still be alive once the rest of us are wiped. Actually, do you know what? All things being equal, I’m thinking you being around is actually pretty made for morale. Like you’re the spectre at the feast, but you’re the one who actually does the catering.”

“Hang on, how is he higher on the ‘being useful to team morale’ pecking order than me?” Lowe said, pointing at Rook. “He’s already dead!”

“Actually, technically I’m not. Just very, very close. And, well, I have the whole supernatural speed and strength thing going for me. Did you miss the part of the story when I put down a whole Shimmerskin squad on my own? I mean, that probably gets me all sorts of brownie points, no? Oh, and didn’t one of them kill you kind of by accident? I mean, I’m not one for blowing my own trumpet here but, when push comes to shove, I’m probably not the one of us getting picked last in P.E here, mate.”

“Fuck you very much, Rook. But you can stay. Surely, though, and no offence here Mylaf, but I’ve got to be more crucial to operations than she is.”

“Who’s she? The cat’s mother?” Mylaf said. “And, sir, need I remind you that one of us has the ability to produce Legendary quality consumables which might be the be all and end all between living and dying and the other one . . . I’m sorry, sir, I’ve never quite been clear what it is you actually do. I mean, know I clean a lot of blood out of your shirts. Is it posssible you are some sort of, I don’t know, jousting dummy?”

“Et tu, Mylaf? You’re a bad influence,” Lowe said to Latham, and then split up Cenorth’s file and threw equal parts to the giggling figures around him. “How about we all agree that each and every one of us is absolutely critical for the success of this operation and that any comparisons as to our differing talents are odious and unnecessary.”

“Yes, why don’t we do that?” Latham said, flicking through the file. “By the gods, a lot of this shit is redacted!”

“Indeed,” Mylaf said, dropping another round of a drink she was calling ‘Rapid Reader’ on the table between them. She said it would make them take on board written information at three times normal speed. Considering the size of Cenorth’s file, Lowe suspected they might well need it if they wanted to gather anything useful before the end of the world. “I would have thought something this difficult to get hold of might have been the unvarnished truth.”Love this novel? Read it on Royal Road to ensure the author gets credit.

Both Rook and Lowe laughed at that. “There’s no such thing as ‘unvarnished truth’ as far as Cuckoo House is concerned,” Lowe said. 

“I doubt even Arkola has the clearance to see an unredacted file,” Rook said. 

That gave Lowe a moment’s pause. Although he’d shared the general details about the memory he’d seen courtesy of Grackle Nuroon, and the gist of his meeting with Arkola, he hadn’t told his friends everything. Especially about there being ways to keep things entirely beyond the reach of the First Floor. Some things were just too freaky to be widely known.

“Sorry, remind me what I’m looking for here,” Mylaf said. “On the few pages that actually have anything I can read on them.”

“We’re working on the theory that Cenorth was either working alongside or, more likely, directing the actions of the Black Knight,” Lowe said. 

“Based on a conversation over a game of chess,” Rook said neutrally. He raised his hands as Lowe shot him a look. “Hey, I’m not saying it’s the worst theory in the world. It’s just, speaking as a guy who got his heart blown out, I’d like a little more certainty around me blaming the boss for that happening. You weren’t the only one who respected him”

Lowe shrugged. “If I had anything else, I’d run with it. But we are where we are. Now, as the boss had a shittier work/life balance than me, we’re exploring the idea that, if he was working with the Black Knight, he must have come across him via work. Considering we now know that the Black Knight was dropping off confidential packages to the Mayor six years ago, anything unusual Cenorth got up to around that time has to be worth exploring.”

“He was the Commander of Cuckoo House. ‘Something unusual’ isn’t needle in a haystack territory. It’s looking for a needle in a needlestack. And a needlestack that has been heavily redacted at that. Fuck this is some weak sauce.” Latham said.

“Well, if you have any better ideas, I’m happy to hear them,” Lowe said. “But as far as I can see, we’ve got a little under two days to locate Arkola’s missing statue and the only way we’re going to do that is if we find the Black Knight.”

“Not strictly true, little man. We can always go out there and pluck ourselves another Shimmerskin off the street and ask him some questions. The guy who popped you in the head is still out there, isn’t he? Maybe he’ll know more about why his OOB squad is active in downtown Soar. Because that’s the bit I can’t figure. They’re not working for the Mayor. And I doubt they’re for the Warden, either. And I don’t think, considering their - you know - casual slaughter, they’re on the Black Knight’s payroll either. Someone put them in the bank either because they thought the Black Knight was going to make a move on the Vault and wanted the security - but how would they know that? - or they were after what the Mayor hid away and the Black Knight swooped in and took over. But either way, that doesn’t change the key question: who’s paying them?”

“Good question. But we’ll call standing out there with a big sign saying ‘come get me’ Plan B. But considering those guys are also looking for the Black Knight, my shout is that we leave them to it right now. If this reading session gets us nowhere then I guess finding them and hoping they’ve already caught him isn’t a terrible secondary option,” Lowe said. 

They read in silence for a while. The only sound was the rustling of paper and the occasional slurps of ‘Rapid Reader.’

“You know,” Rook said eventually, flipping a page, “if he hadn’t turned out to be, you know, a complete shitstain, some of the stuff Cenorth pulled off during his career was actually pretty impressive. And this is only the stuff not redacted.” 

“Tell me about it. It’s why I was so fucking psyched to finally get moved to his team. I idolised the stories about him.” 

Rook let out a low whistle. “Look at this—seven-year undercover infiltration of the Shadow Market. He managed to get himself appointed as one of the fucking arbiters of their internal disputes, and when he finally burned the whole operation to the ground, they had no idea it was him. The report says it took them months to even work out how they got dismantled, let alone who did it.” 

Lowe nodded. “That was the boss. Play every side until you’re the one pulling the strings. I remember hearing about that op—back then, they said it was some internal collapse. No one ever said a thing about it being us.” 

Mylaf, skimming through another section, gave a short laugh. “My word—look at this one! Six-man assault team tries to take him out while he’s - sorry is the term ‘deep cover’ - in Redhaven. They believed they had him cornered in a warehouse. The report says there was nowhere to run. No way to call for help.” She flicked the page. “Next note? They found him walking out an hour later, covered in their blood, missing a pinky finger, and somehow managing to be the only witness to the whole thing. No bodies left. No proof. No nothing. Just your man Cenorth, casually submitting his exit paperwork like he hadn’t just committed six perfect murders.” 

Rook shook his head. “Fuck me. No wonder the brass let him do whatever he wanted.” 

“They had to,” Lowe said. “He was too useful. If you needed something done quietly, you sent him in. If you needed something done loudly—well, you still sent him, because by the time the bodies hit the floor, he’d have an ironclad reason why it was all perfectly justified.” He leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. “I spent years wanting to be him. Wanting to be picked by him. And when I finally was? It felt like I’d made it. And now? Now I realise the only reason I ever made the cut… is because I was useful to him.” 

“To be fair, he does seem pretty keen on you, sir. I doubt he could have recommended you more times for Commendations if he’d tried,” Mylaf, said scanning another page. 

Lowe shot her a look, but Mylaf wasn’t paying attention. She turned a page, frowned, then turned it back again as if double-checking something. “Hmmm,” she said. 

“What?” Rook said.

“Just something strange, is all.” Mylaf tapped the paper. “Did you know that, under him, Cuckoo House didn’t recruit any new operatives for years? Then all of a sudden, Cenorth pulled in five new recruits in no time at all.” 

Lowe’s spine straightened slightly. “Come again?” 

“This section, it’s a record of his personal notes on any and all applications made for transfer to his team. Year after year, he just writes the same sort of thing: ‘not suitable.’ ‘Insufficient aptitude.’ ‘No potential.’ Then, suddenly, in one single year, there’s five names he’s marked as ‘goers.’ And after those five are moved to his team? We’re back to nothing again.” 

“Goers?” Latham said. “What do you mean?” 

Mylaf turned the page around and held it out. “See for yourself. He draws little horses next to them.” 

Lowe took the paper, expecting… well, he didn’t know what he was expecting. But it wasn’t this. Rook leaned over his shoulder. “Horses?” His brow furrowed. “Wait. Fuck! Those aren’t horses.” 

Lowe realised it the exact same moment Rook did. His mouth went dry. 

“They’re knights,” Rook breathed. “Black Knights.” 

Lowe barely heard him. His eyes had locked instead onto the names beneath the scribbled drawings. Names he knew. Names that had shaped his life. Names that had fought beside him. Bled beside him. Died beside him. 

Arman 

Coda 

Rook 

Faulks 

… and Lowe.

                “So, let me get this straight. We’re saying that Cenorth recruited the five of us because he thought one of us had the potential to be… what, his asset? Like an undercover agent inside Cuckoo House? Someone who, sure, did the day job, saluted the flag, served the fucking organisation, but was also, in secret, working for him?” 

Lowe said nothing. 

Rook’s voice sharpened. “That’s what we’re saying, yeah? Because if that’s true, do you realise what that fucking means? That’s not some ordinary level of fucked up. That’s not ‘oh, the boss played favourites.’ That’s deep, systemic, treasonous manipulation. Oh, and it got us all - well not all, not you! - but the rest of us, fucking killed” 

Lowe still didn’t say anything.

“I mean, it’s not like handlers don’t recruit people inside the Security Services all the time, but not from inside the fucking recruitment process! No one, who isn’t up to no fucking good, tries to build his own fucking agents inside Cuckoo House! That’s not how these things are supposed to work! You recruit an asset from the outside. Someone already compromised. Someone already in trouble. Someone with a reason to turn against the system. You don’t groom them from the fucking start! And why us five? What about us five made it seem like we’d be up for it!” 

Latham opened his mouth to speak, but Lowe but a hand on his arm. He was watching Rook. Trying to see what Cenorth might have seen in him. Back then. Trying to see if this . . . anger at the idea of him being crooked was real or manufactured.

“I mean, do you know how long it takes to properly flip someone? How careful you have to be? How many fucking hours you have to spend understanding who they are before you can so much as hint that there might be a second job for them? And he just—what? Looked at a bunch of fresh recruits and picked five of us at random?” Rook gestured wildly at the file. “What, did he just assume one of us would turn? That we’d become his Black Knight? Or was it a game to him? Throw five people into the meat grinder and see who comes out loyal to him?” 

Lowe stared at the file, the old drawing marking them each as potential ‘goers.’ The little knights. Black Knights. 

“But fuck me, Jana. This wasn’t some quick off-the-books side hustle. If we’re right, this was years. Years of playing the long game. Years of him shaping one of us. Trying to see which one of us would be his.” Rook’s voice dropped lower, more dangerous. “And none of the rest of us even knew it was happening.”

Latham looked between them. “Look, I get that this is shitty, but I’m not really sure how much it helps us right now.” Lowe and Rook both turned to him, but Latham wasn’t done. He waved a hand at the file, exasperated. “Cenorth is dead. The op to catch the Black Knight went up in flames. And all five names on that list?” He tapped the paper. “Dead. Sure, you’re a fucking cockroach and bounced back. And you—” he waved at Rook, “—have your own weird shit going on. But let’s be real here. You all died. You were all killed.” 

Mylaf frowned. “But two of them are still here.” 

“Yeah,” Latham said, “And assuming neither of you are involved in some ridiculously convoluted game of tinker, tailor, soldier, serial killer, then - sure - the chances are one of your dead mates was the Black Knight. Until, of course, Cenorth decided to kill them and set Lowe up for a Classtration. But that still doesn’t answer who sent the two of you the file. And who robbed the bank, stole Arkola’s fucking statue and wiped a bunch of Shimmerskins!” 

There was a beat. Then— 

“Three,” Rook said. 

Latham blinked. “What?” 

“Three,” Rook repeated, quieter this time. “There’s still three of us still kicking around.” Love this novel? Read it on Royal Road to ensure the author gets credit.

***

"I'm not going to lie, this is playing a bit fast and loose with the words ‘kicking around,’" Lowe said, staring at the thing in the bed. 

The room smelled of mana potions and something rancid, something that clung to the air like old sweat and burnt hair. Expensive mana potions, at least—’Kalhorgan the Never Merciful General Hospital’ wasn’t the kind of facility you ended up in by accident. If you were brought here, it was because someone had paid a lot of money to make sure you didn’t die, whether you wanted to or not. 

And Coda? 

It turned out Coda had not died. But he wasn’t exactly living, either. 

Lowe stared at the ruin of a man in the bed, and found himself grasping for something—anything—else to think about. “I know his wife never liked him being in the Service,” he said quietly. He couldn’t remember her name, not for the life of him right now, but he could picture her. Short, dark hair, sharp eyes, always watching him when he came around. She hadn’t been rude, exactly. Just… wary. Like she thought he was some bad influence dragging her husband deeper into something he had no business being part of. 

And maybe she’d been right. 

“She was always on at him to get a transfer,” Lowe continued. “Some desk job. Something that didn’t put him in the firing line. I figured she must have arranged to have him buried somewhere else.” 

He’d thought it at the time, in passing, in the way you think about things that don’t really matter because there are bigger, bloodier concerns occupying your mind. But now? Now he felt like a fucking idiot. He’d stood at the graves of Arman and Faulks, watched as the dirt swallowed what was left of them, and never once questioned why Coda wasn’t there too. 

It had been a bad time. The worst of times. He’d been stitched up, beaten down, trying to claw his way out of the meat grinder that had followed the massacre at Goldleaf Park. And then had come his Classtration. There hadn’t been room for sentiment. So he’d just… accepted what he was told. Never asked. Never wondered what had become of him. 

And now, standing here, staring at what was left of his teammate, he felt the guilt wash over him again. Because whether or not he’d realised it—whether or not anyone had—Coda had never left the battlefield. 

And Lowe had never even fucking noticed. 

Your team is dead. 

The Black Knight killed them all. 

No one had lied to him. But no one had told him the whole truth, either. And now, standing at the foot of Coda’s bed, he understood why. Because there was a difference between surviving and surviving. 

“Hey, what can I say?” Rook said. “Not all of us can tank a devastating, fatal injury and come bouncing back.” 

Lowe barely heard him. He was still looking at what remained of Coda. The sheets were pristine, white, barely disturbed. A stark contrast to the thing lying in them. Coda had been melted. 

His body was a ruin of scar tissue and fused muscle where flesh had tried—and ultimately failed—to heal in anything resembling the right shape. His face, what was left of it, was a mess of smooth, waxy skin, stretched taut over half a skull, the other side hardened into something that barely looked . . . well, human. One eye was gone, the socket sealed over like cooling wax, while the remaining one twitched slightly under the closed lid, as though trapped in a dream it couldn’t escape. 

His arms were… wrong. The left one had been amputated below the elbow, but the right . . . the right had fused at the joints, the fingers curled into something that barely resembled a hand anymore. If it had ever worked, it certainly didn’t now. 

The only movement came from his chest, the slow rise and fall of the mana-operated ventilator. The quiet hiss of alchemical tubes feeding him something that wasn’t quite air. But for what? For this? 

“How the fuck is he still alive?” 

Rook tilted his head, eyes flicking over the room, the softly glowing sigils carved into the medical frame, the glow of enchanted fluids running through translucent tubing. 

“Best guess?” Rook said. “Someone paid a shitload of money to keep him that way.” 

“Why?” 

No answer. Just the unnatural hum of preservation wards stitched into the walls. Just the steady rhythm of a man who should have died, who had died, at least in every way that mattered. 

If he concentrated, Lowe could see the faint threads of residual mana binding Coda’s body together, cradling his ruined flesh in an intricate weave of suspended animation. Not healing. Not repairing. Just holding him. Like something that should have let go a long time ago but refused. A half-life, strung together with runes and refusal. 

“I should have known.” His voice came out rougher than he intended. “I should have asked.” 

Rook was quiet for a moment. “Well,” he said, “you’re asking now.” 

            







	***





                Back then, they’d been Cuckoo House’s best. 

Intelligence operatives, specialist investigators, black-baggers, and deep-cover agents. Between them, they’d had Skills to die for. Classes that were specifically calibrated to uncover misdeeds and do it with flair. They’d been precision instruments honed for targeted application, and yet none of them had been able to figure out Coda was the Black Knight. 

So, it should have been harder than it was proving right now to unpick it all. 

That it wasn’t, was just plain embarrassing. How fucking arrogant had they been back then?

However, now they knew what they were looking for, it had been almost insultingly easy to piece things together.

Lowe would have liked to think that something which had completely evaded the best minds in the Security Service might have taken more effort than a few hours of late-night spitballing from a Classtrated washout, a Temple Warder with something approaching an eating disorder, a Drudge, and an on-again-off-again zombie. 

But once the theory stopped being a theory - once they started working on the assumption that Cenorth had been looking for a successor in his off-the-books operations, and that Coda had clearly been the one he tagged - it was like the whole thing came loose.  

It was like a dam bursting. 

Lowe thought back to Coda’s throwaway comment about the rope. Something said eighteen odd month ago that had stuck in the back of Lowe’s mind, useless until now. But once he started really combing through Grid View, using the right lens, the slips were everywhere. It was humiliating, really. Coda had made a stupid number of such mistakes for someone in their unit - with all their wonderful Skills - not to have picked up on.  

As he came upon the . . . well, not clues. Massive flashing red flags with ‘it’s me!’ written on them, Lowe marked each down in his notebook, his stomach sinking further with every example. By the tenth instance of Coda demonstrating knowledge of something he shouldn’t have known, Latham hissed between his teeth.  

“Fucking hell, little man. He was basically confessing. Was this guy an idiot? Or was he mocking you?”  

Lowe and Rook exchanged a glance. Because they were both thinking the same thing.

Coda had been one of them. After all, they’d worked together for years. He might not have been the best of them, but he had been solid. Dependable. Funny. He might never have been the unit’s shining star - that was Lowe’s role, after all - but if you got partnered with him, you knew it was going to be a good job. A safe job. Working with Coda was far better than being saddled with Arman, bitching endlessly about procedure. Or Faulks, twitching from blitz stick withdrawal, ready to storm a room three steps ahead of the plan.  

He’d been a decent guy. Not too quick. Not too slow. But the one you could rely on never to drop a ball.

And, after everything, Coda was the fucking Black Knight? Coda had gotten his hands on something of Arkola’s and delivered it to the Mayor.  Coda had been murdering the great and the good of Soar?

It didn’t make sense.  

But then, after a few messages to and from Staffen—messages that mostly involved her screaming in FUCKING capital letters—it turned out Coda’s bank account was far, far, far too healthy. Which is why his melted semi-corpse was able to be residing comfortably in ‘Kalhorgan the Never Merciful’ General

Lowe had stared at the numbers Staffen had quoted. “I thought you looked into this,” he said, as he turned to Rook. “Back then? I have a distinct memory of giving you the order to look into all of us.”  

“I did,” Rook said. “But according to this, all the gold is in his wife’s name.”  

“And that was enough to baffle you?”  

“Don’t break my balls over this, Jana. I didn’t really think it was any of us. Neither did you. I looked but, to tell the truth, I didn’t look that hard.”  

“Fuck.”  

“Fuck,” Rook agreed.  

And now, here they were.  

Standing at the bedside of a man who, as far as they could tell, had spectacularly betrayed them all.  

Lowe looked down at what remained of Coda. He had seen bodies burned, shredded, torn apart. But this—this was something else. This was a man caught halfway between survival and whatever came after.  

“I don’t know about you,” Rook said, “but I don’t see this guy blowing his way into the Vault and massacring a bunch of Shimmerskins. Unless he’s much more spry than he looks.”This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.

“No. And, after what happened to him in Goldleaf Park, I doubt he was the one who killed the Highberg child, either.”

“So we’re putting that on Cenorth?”

“Probably,” Lowe said.

“Who is also dead.”

“Who is.”

“So who sent us the files?”

“No idea. But I bet Coda’s got all sorts of tales to tell that will probably help us work that out.”

There was a pause. “Let me guess. You want me to Threshold Guardian this up?” Rook said.

“Well, we’ve gotten this far,” Lowe said, “but we’re fucking nowhere, are we?” He gestured at Coda’s broken form in the bed. “I’m coming round to the realisation that Coda might have been the Black Knight once upon a time, but he’s sure as fuck not it right now. And sure, maybe Cenorth was pulling his strings back then, but it’s clearly not the boss calling the shots now. I’m all for people coming back from the dead but, believe me, once Hel’s sisters had finished with him, there definitely wasn’t enough left behind for an encore. ”  

Lowe looked around the room’s spacious interior and out its window, where the Celestial Temple dominated the skyline. Was Arkola watching even now? “Look Rook, we’ve got just over a day and a half before Arkola pulls the plug on Soar, and we’re no fucking closer to finding his statue. I don’t know about you, but personally, I’d love to avoid being in the city when an Eldritch god-king has a temper tantrum because his favourite toy hasn’t been returned to him.”  

He stopped, hands on his hips, staring down at the ruined man before them.  

“So,” Lowe said, voice dropping into something cold. “Because I’m all about a redemption arc, here’s your chance—Threshold Guardian—to make up for being thwarted by the equivalent of ‘no ill-gotten money in this hand, my good sir.’ Why don’t you use your newly acquired Class to find out exactly what this fucker might still know.”  

Because Coda might not be able to talk. But that didn’t mean he had nothing to say.  

***

Rook reached out, placing his fingertips lightly against Coda’s ruined temple, the waxy, melted skin barely warm under his touch. His other hand braced against the bed frame, fingers curling like he was already pulling something from the air. Then the mana began to flow between them. It came in slow at first—a shimmer around his shoulders, a barely perceptible tremor in the air. Then it built.  

Lowe could feel it from where he stood in the doorway. A crushing pressure in his skull. A strange, oppressive squeezing that sent a shiver down his spine. Gods know how Rook might be feeling when he did this. The air bent towards his friend like something unseen was being siphoned through him, pooling at the point where his hand met Coda’s flesh.  

Then the room dropped in temperature.  

Not a slow creep of a chill, but an immediate, violent snap—like stepping out into a snowstorm after leaving a furnace.  

Lowe watched Rook grit his teeth, eyes narrowing as his body jerked and bucked against some unseen resistance. He’d explained that the mana draw in accessing Coda’s mind would be massive. Certainly far more than Lowe could have channelled himself. The sigils on Coda’s medical frame blew out, their careful balancing of his suspended existence interfered with by whatever Rook was doing.

A hum filled the air and the smell of burned mana curled at the back of Lowe’s throat. Even the lights dimmed, just slightly, but enough to notice as the Level 50 Threshold Guardian took charge of the man’s . . . soul? Was that what Rook did when he used this Skill? Lowe wasn’t clear. He really did need to find out more about his friend’s Class.

But that was for another time, Lowe thought, turning away and looking up and down the corridor outside the room..  

He was keeping watch because neither of them thought that the Nurses were going to be wild about them fiddling with such a well paying patient. He needed to be watching the hall to give Rook a head’s up to . . . well, get out of Coda’s head.

Lowe leaned against the doorframe, absently watching the corridor beyond. Another expensive room in an expensive building full of expensive people. He’d been spending a lot of his time around wealth lately. The kind that could bury secrets deep enough that most people would never think to dig.  

Outside, the crowds around the hospital moved with an effortless rhythm. White-coated staff walked briskly between rooms, their uniforms crisp and newly pressed. Carts rattled by, stacked with neatly arranged alchemical vials and glowing diagnostic tools that most public-sector clinics would kill to get their hands on. Money couldn’t buy you happiness, maybe. But it could certainly buy you a better class of healthcare.  Which, Lowe thought, was probably much the same thing.

Down the far end of the hall, someone was arguing over a dosage of something or other, their voice hushed but heated. Near Lowe, a doctor, expensive coat unbuttoned, leaned against the wall, rubbing at his temples. Lowe didn’t have to hear him to know exactly the complaint he was making - shifts too long. Pay too short. It was interesting that universal truth was the same, even in a place like this. People could always use more money.

Coda’s bank account . . . 

Lowe banged his fist into the wall. Of all the names - of everyone who could have been the Black Knight! He still couldn’t square it away. And yet, here they were. 

But if Coda had been the Black Knight, and Cenorth had been pulling his strings, who the fuck was running the show now they were both off the table? 

A nurse walked past him, pushing a cart. Lowe barely registered her. Then, maybe half a minute later, he saw her again.  

He frowned. Had she looped back?  

No, there she was moving in the same direction. She was still pushing a cart at the same pace, with the same sense of vacant determination about her body language. But she hadn’t turned around. He turned his head, scanning down the corridor in the opposite direction.  

Another Nurse. Same uniform. Same cart. Same fucking face.  

Twins? Sure. Maybe. But—  

Fucking Shimmerskin.  

Lowe turned back into the room, running straight to Rook, who was still locked in his deep-channel Skill, face tense. He grabbed his shoulder, shaking him hard. “Wrap it up, Rook! We’ve got company!”  

Rook’s fingers twitched against Coda’s skull, eyes unfocused like he was halfway between worlds. Which, Lowe thought, was a pretty damn accurate bit of description. 

Frustrated, Lowe crossed back across the room and looked back down the hallway.  The nurse—the second one—was almost at the door. And she didn’t have a cart anymore. Just a fucking massive sword. 

And a slow, deliberate smile.

            







	***





                Lowe barely had time to shout a warning before the Nurse lunged for him. 

One moment, she was standing at the threshold, smiling and the next she was a blur of motion, her body expanding mid-step, shifting from lean medical professional to something bigger, broader and not at all someone he’d be willing to accept a bedbath from. The fabric of her uniform stretched, then tore, splitting apart as she grew, her bones reconfiguring with a series of grinding pops.  

The sword in her hands was a massive slab of black metal which she moved far too fast for its size towards Lowe’s ribs in a sweeping horizontal slash. He barely dodged in time and his shoulder screamed as he twisted away, momentum carrying him backwards in a staggered roll across the polished floor. The blade slammed into the doorframe behind him, splinters flying as half the fucking doorway exploded away.  

The Shimmerskin didn’t slow its attack. She - Lowe thought he’d go for that right now. Finding the appropriate pronoun wasn’t an absolute priority considering what was going on - moved like a wrecking ball, following the swing as her body was already shrinking back into a more compact form as she adjusted to close the distance. 

The counter-cut came immediately, this time aimed for his throat.  

Lowe’s legs collapsed from under him, saving him from a beheading as the sword whistled overhead, slicing clean through the wall beside him and into the table beyond. Alchemical fluids burst from the beakers on it, spilling across the floor in a mix of blues and greens.  

Lowe kicked out as he rolled, somehow managing to catch his attacker in the knee. It felt like kicking a fucking boulder and Roll with the Punches sprang into action to repair a bunch of snapped bones.  

And the Shimmerskin barely twitched. But her return strike was not a joy. It was a completely untelegraphed punch that caved in the tiles where his head had been a second earlier. Lowe twisted, barely keeping his footing as he skidded backwards over the spilt liquids from the previous attack, teeth gritted. Trust Coda to be in the only hospital without some sort of guard. She was fast. Too fast. And the level disparity between them was glaring. 

But then—  

She hesitated. Just for a fraction of a second. Her head tilted and her eyes flicked up and down, measuring him again.  She could tell there was something . . . off about him. The Shimmerskin knew she’d hit him. Could tell her blows had landed. Maybe not full force, but enough that a puny Level 26 should be a smear on the floor. But he wasn’t. And she couldn’t understand why.  

Surprise bitch, Lowe thought, almost giddy as she charged forward before his attacker could resume her attack. And that she wasn’t expecting. Neither was she expecting him to be able to match her speed. And she especially wasn’t expecting Slugger. 

The impact was like he’d brought a whole battery of cannons to the party.  

The Shimmerskin’s body folded around his fist, ribs snapping, torso compressing like an accordion before she launched backwards down the corridor, slamming through a wall which caused the entire hospital to shake.  

Chunks of marble and wood exploded outward as she crashed into the next room, sending a rolling bed flying into the far wall. A patient inside—a man wired up to half a dozen mana monitors—screamed in terror before trying to flee in his gown.  

Lowe staggered, breathing hard, hands clenched. His knuckles hurt, even as Roll with the Punches repaired his hand. His entire arm felt like he’d just tried to punch through Arkola itself. His HP had dropped significantly, but it was already climbing again, as he pushed even more mana into Roll with the Punches, to restore the damage at a ridiculous pace.  

The Shackled Grasp hummed with Pressure against his chest, invisible chains tightening around his bones, collecting the damage he’d already taken. He used some of it to refill his rapidly vanishing mana, but stored the rest. He figured he was going to need it.

Which was lucky, because the Shimmerskin was already coming back for more. And he didn’t think she’d be underestimating the poor little Level 26 anymore.  

The attacker’s form shifted, bones knitting, her frame adapting as she straightened. Much taller this time. Latham tall and broad. More mass packed onto her shoulders, skin rippling as she adjusted her core to compensate for the damage. The dented side of her ribs popped outward and reforming as she exhaled.  Then she grinned again. 

The hallway blurred as she attacked. She expanded mid-motion, surging forward with impossible momentum, sword flashing this way and that. Lowe barely sidestepped in time, and the blade ripped through the wall behind him like paper, severing leylines in a shower of mana.  

Lowe fell back. Dodged a second strike. Then a third. Feinted left—ducked a rising knee—stepped inside her guard and . . . A palm caught him mid-dodge. The force was like being hit by a speeding carriage. It wasn’t quite as hard as when Drefleck had hit him. But neither was it a loving kiss from Arebella before bedtime.If you spot this narrative on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.

Lowe flew.  

His back caved into the far wall, air ripped from his lungs as the impact cracked the stone panels behind him. He hit the floor with a bone-jarring thud and his vision momentarily whited out.  

His HP plummeted. Then surged back up as Roll with the Punches kicked in. No Blood of the Phoenix today. At least, not yet. He spat blood onto the polished tiles. Okay. That one fucking hurt.  

The Shimmerskin was already walking toward him, sword dragging against the floor, the metal screaming against tile. She was moving mockingly slowly. She thought she had him. She didn’t have shit.

The Shackled Grasp coiled tighter around him, the invisible chains aching now, Pressure mounting with every second. The damage he’d taken—every single bit of it—was sitting there, waiting. Banked. Waiting to be spent. Lowe grinned, spitting more blood onto the pristine floor.  

“Let’s see how you fucking like it.” And all at once, Retaliation Strike was unleashed

His entire body whipped forward as the chains blasted from him, a raw shockwave of force rolling outward from his core as a single devastating explosion right between the Shimmerskin’s eyes.  

The damage hit all at once, overwhelming whatever defensive measures the assassin had.  

She crumpled, face imploding from the accumulated Pressure of their fight. Bone fractured, skin ripped and her entire head collapsed inward with a meaty crunch. She didn’t fly anywhere this time. She just broke. The light flickered in her eyes. The shifting of her form faltered and then failed. The Nurse sagged forward, mouth slightly open, the edges of her body losing all sense of cohesion. And then—  

Her body settled.  

And the corpse which fell at Lowe’s feet wasn’t a nurse anymore. It wasn’t anything recognisable. Just yet another non-descript man, faceless in every possible way.  

Rook was standing in the doorway. “I take my eyes off you for five minutes . . .”  

***

“I mean, I’m not against any of my Investigators kicking arse and taking names,” Staffen said as she watched the remains of the Shimmerskin get bagged up and carted away for Lant to poke and prod at. “I think my record is fucking clear on that.”  

Lowe made a vague noise of agreement.  

“But it’s a bit of a fucking headspin,” she continued, turning to look at him, “that you, Jana Oh-I-have-No-Class-I’m-Ever-So-Fragile Lowe, apparently have the moxy to take down a Level 50 assassin. I mean, bore the fucker to death with all your ever-so-clever banter, sure. But beat the bastard to death with your bare hands?” She whistled low. “Nah. That’s a bit of a surprise.”  

“You wound me, Commander. Truly.”  

“Oh, I doubt that,” she said. “Seeing as it appears you’re completely invincible now.”  

“Let’s not get carried away.”  

“No, let’s,” she countered, stepping closer. “Let’s get carried away, Lowe. Let’s really dig into how my Classtrated, de-statted, barely-qualifies-as-a-threat Inspector just went twelve rounds with a fucking apex predator and walked away not looking like freshly processed burger meat. And I’ll throw in a few idle worries I have about how every mental Skill I throw at you is bouncing off like you’re made of fucking rubber. Let’s talk about that, shall we?”  

“Well,” Lowe said. “Now that’s just natural talent.”  

“Fuck off, wanker!”  

“Pretty rude, boss. Especially as I’ve just been quite the hero of the hour.”  

“Lowe!”  

“Staffen?”  

“I swear to all the fucking gods, if you make me start waterboarding you for your own fucking benefit, I will do it with a smile.”  

“Which sounds deeply unethical, boss.”  

“Sounds deeply fucking likely, at this rate.” She turned and put her fist through the wall. This appeared to calm her down plenty. “So? Come on, then. What little secret weapon are you sitting on? Some dodgy artefact? A cursed blessing? Have you been getting freaky with powers beyond our ken? Again?”  

“To be fair, boss, what’s just happened here was barely my fault. All I can say is that—” He gestured vaguely at the mess of the corridor. “—sometimes, the wrong man in the right place can make all the difference.”  

“You are such a fucking prick!”  

“And yet,” Lowe said, “you continue to employ me.”  

“Only because the paperwork to get rid of you is even more annoying than dealing with you directly.”  

“And here was me thinking it was love.”  

“Fuck off,” and with that, she stomped off towards Lant and his team muttering under her breath.  

Lowe watched her go, exhaling slowly.  

“You should have told her,” Rook said.

“What about?”

“Fucking hell, Lowe. About everything! Cenorth and Coda. Arkola’s missing statue. The fucking deadline until the end of Soar!”

Lowe shook his head. “No. Not yet.”

“Why not?”

Lowe glanced into the room where Coda still lay, the chest of his ruined body rising and falling in slow rhythm. The sight didn’t get easier the longer he looked at it. “Let’s just say I’m having all sorts of trust issues right about now,” he said. “I’ll tell her when I actually have something to report. And, you never know, if things don’t work out, I might not even have to do that.” He turned back to Rook. “You know, if everything goes boom. Speaking of which, did you manage to Threshold Guardian anything up from Coda?”  

“Maybe.”  

“That’s a shit answer.”  

“Yeah, well, I’ve got a shit headache,” Rook said. “But before we get into all that, can you do something about all the fucking level-up blinking you’ve got going on? It’s giving me an aneurysm just looking at you.”  

Lowe sighed. Ah. Yeah. There it was. That constant, nagging flicker at the edges of his vision, a low, rhythmic pulsing, like a heartbeat he couldn’t ignore. 

Quickly glancing at some of the wording in the notifications he’d received as the Shimmerskin died, he suspected this wasn’t going to be one of his more straightforward level-ups.  

            







	***





                Before we begin, let me make one thing clear—this is not my preferred method of communication. All things being equal, I would have spoken more freely when you visited me earlier. I would have said exactly what needed saying, exactly how it needed to be said. But right now? Things are not equal. Not even close. Nevertheless, those listening will have been left in no uncertainty as to the seriousness of my message.  If things play out how I would now expect, I would anticipate the return of what was taken… very shortly. Those who took it may seek to replace me, but they will not countenance the destruction of Soar.  In this, you played your part admirably.

There was no way for Lowe to respond to Arkola’s message—it was just a notification, after all.  A line of text flickering at the edge of his vision. But still, his fists clenched, and Slugger activated. A useless, physical reaction to something he couldn’t touch. Something he couldn’t fight.  

Because that was the thing, wasn’t it?  

This entire situation—this entire fucking case—was just him reacting. Being used. Chasing. Trying to outthink, outplay and outmaneuver forces that seemed to have already mapped out every route before he even knew what game they were playing. Cenorth had been moving him for years before Lowe had even known he was a piece on the board. And Arkola? Arkola was hardly even pretending that Lowe’s choices were his own. He’d summoned him to the fucking First Floor to play a game of Whisper Mr Dullard with the end of Soar as his stake.

And the worst part? It was working. It was still fucking working.  

Lowe hated this. Hated the knowledge that he was being nudged with just enough breadcrumbs laid out to make him feel like he was the one solving things. And now, what? He was just supposed to sit back, keep his mouth shut, and let events play out like Arkola had already decided they would?  

But there no response. Of course there was no fucking response. He dismissed the message and a second later, the next notification in the sequence replaced it. Because, of course, it did. Because nothing in this world was going to stop just because Jana Lowe was pissed off about it.

I am not sorry to have used you once more. Your arrival on the First Floor will have set all the right tongues wagging, stirring the precise conversations I required. And now, the conclusion I sought - have desired for so long - will shortly be reached. A wrong will soon be—partially—righted. And, for that, I am pleased. 

Well, as long as you are happy, you fucking smug bastard, Lowe thought. Glad to have been of help. 

If I know you—and I believe I do—you will find  being used in such a way infuriating. You will convince yourself that I am responsible for any number of deaths, but that is simply not the truth. Something of mine was stolen. And the guilt for what followed lies solely with those who took it. It is not my role in all this to intercede in the choices of men. You must have faith there will be a reckoning for that. And soon. But that is, of course, by the by. No more of that.

Yeah, sure, Lowe though. Let’s not focus on all the people who had died to get their hands on Arkola’s fucking bird. Wouldn’t want to bring the atmosphere down, would we? He dismissed the third message, but they kept on coming.

My little gift from the Dungeon saved you this time. A necessary intervention—after all, I would hate for you to fall before you’ve seen this story through to its conclusion. But do not mistake that reprieve for protection. It will not be enough should what I have foreseen come to pass. 

Now, whilst even I have certain restrictions on what I am allowed to do, there are always loopholes. And when it comes to rewards? My parameters are pleasingly… broad. Especially when a plucky little Level 26 somehow manages to drop a foe above Level 50. Oh, yes. On that occasion, no-one on the Council is going to raise a single complaint if I decide to get my sticky little fingers involved. Particularly if I get creative.

A jolt ran through Lowe as his Core screen was suddenly opened.

Name: Jana Lowe  

Level: 26  

Class: Removed  

Primary Attributes:

- Strength: 120  

- Dexterity: 90  

- Intelligence: 295  

- Wisdom: 238  

- Charisma: 60  

- Constitution: 76  

Secondary Attributes:

- Perception: 95  

- Willpower: 99  

- Luck: 63  

Hmm. I do find all these numbers quite fascinating. Such an efficient little system—neatly tracking who holds power and who does not. But you’ve been cheating a little, haven’t you? Someone’s found access to Level 2, have they? Oh, what fun. Well, I suppose dropping someone nearly twice your Level deserves some sort of recognition, does it not? Let’s say, I don’t know, 105 Progress Points? Now, if I were you—though, of course, I am not—I might suggest putting those into Perception and seeing what happens. But what do I know? I’m just a supreme being. 

Lowe rolled his eyes. Did he really want to put 105 Progress Points into Perception. He had never heard of anyone investing that heavily into a Secondary Attribute. Fuck it, he’d barely heard of anyone putting anything into them beyond the usual rounding out. Secondary Attributes were the scaffolding, the extra bits you considered, not the thing you poured into.

But here he was. Holding a hand over a decision that no one else had ever made.

I’m just a supreme being, Arkola had said, so damn amused with himself. Well, at some stage, you just had to take things on faith. Fuck. He hated that word. Faith was what got people killed. Faith was what made them stop asking questions, stop looking for the trap. Faith was what had made Lowe trust the system. Trust Coda. Trust Cenorth. 

It was faith that had gotten his entire team killed.

But, before he could second-guess himself, he slammed the points in Perception. The effect was immediate and the number in his Core started to climb. Fast. Lowe barely had time to register it when, just as it had twice before, the number slammed to a halt the moment it hit 200.

Then, another screen materialised before him.

Allocated Progress Points have reached the maximum.Do you wish to rank Perception up?

Lowe did. Immediately, the text around Perception – 200 turned gold, the same colour as his Intelligence and Wisdom..

Then he got the next message

Bonus +50 PP for bringing third Core Attribute to Level 2.Please note that these P.P. must be allocated to a Level 1 Core Attribute.

I am going to assume you have done that, the penultimate message in the queue declared, and you are now more, erm… Perceptive than you were before. To be honest, it doesn't really matter where you put the other 50. Although, considering your various… personality defaults, I might suggest Charisma. But that’s all by-the-by. Use them up so we can finish this little charade.Stolen story; please report.

Lowe dropped the fifty points in Dexterity - just because he had a powerful healing Skill didn’t mean it wouldn’t be nice to be able to dodge out of the way occasionally - and considered leaving the final message in this little bundle of joy from Arkola well alone. 

It felt like, for his entire fucking life, he’d been used.  First by Cenorth. His boss. His mentor. A man he’d pretty much idolised. Pulled into whatever off-the-books, long-game, backroom bullshit he’d been orchestrating. Manipulated from the start and, apparently, chosen for ir all without even knowing it.  

And now? Arkola was having a go. A god who didn’t even pretend it was anything other than a game. Who spoke like all of this—Lowe’s choices. His struggles. Fuck, his life!—was some amusing curiosity to be prodded and experimented on. A little diversion to pass the time. Lowe felt something hot and furious rise in his chest. Was that it, then? Was he ever going to be anything more than a useful little piece on someone else’s fucking board?  

A knight, nudged into place.  

A rook, standing in the way of something bigger.  

A pawn, pushed just far enough to be sacrificed.  

He was fucked off about it. More than fucked off. It sat wrong in him, like something rotting. Like something deep in his gut was curling in protest. He hated this. But more than that? He hated that it kept working.

Lowe opened the final message that had accompanied his reward for defeating the Shimmerskin.

And now that is done, let us turn to the serious part. What was mine will find its way back to me ahead of the deadline. You can be sure of that. I am. But it will be to your advantage to pretend you do not know that is to come to pass.  I imagine those still searching for it will become… frantic. Pay attention to those who appear to know such a deadline exists and should not. This may well be that this is the last, true advantage I can give you. Make best use of the boons I have provided - the relic and the Progress Points. Powerful forces are at play, Jana Lowe, and I would have you find your peace. But be aware. I am not the only one in Soar from whom something precious has recently been taken.

Lowe dismissed the message, and turned back to watch the removal of the Shimmerskin’s body from the hospital corridor.

Lowe had seen a lot of weird shit in his life.  

He'd seen a man swallow a mana grenade by accident and burp out a localised time loop. He’d watched a Pickpocket try to rob a Priest and get shocked so thoroughly that, for a week, he could only speak in religious doctrine. Which wouldn’t have been a problem had it been his god he was quoting. Apparently, though, the god he worshipped looked askance at that sort of thing and had taken . . . umbrage. And about three years ago he’d arrested a man for trying to smuggle himself across Soar’s border inside an enchanted beer keg which had turned out to be a rather innovative mimic that had lawyered up effectively.

But right now, watching the Shimmerskin’s body being wheeled to the mortuary by two - at least according to them - profoundly underpaid Morgue Attendants, Lowe had to admit what he was seeing right now was pretty freaky.

Because the corpse wasn’t settling. It was still changing.  

Lowe squinted. One moment, it was the featureless form of a dead Shimmerskin. A man so utterly non-descript that he was barely distinguishable from a badly drawn mannequin. The next, it flickered. Its arms twitched, its legs moving, as if some part of it hadn’t gotten the memo that it was supposed to stay dead.  

One of the Attendants nudged the other and muttered, “You seeing that?”  

“Oh yeah,” the second one said, glancing at the shifting corpse, then at the three-quarters of a cup of coffee still left in his hand, before setting it down very deliberately on a nearby counter. “Yep. That’s me done drinking caffeine today.”  

“I better go tell Lant,” the first one sighed, shaking his head. “This always seems to fucking happen when we get called to a body from your lot.”  

Lowe realised he was being obliquely  addressed. “Excuse me? Define your lot.”  

“Security Services. When you people drop corpses, it’s like a dog leaving chewed-up slippers on the doorstep, and half the time they’re not entirely finished with whatever they were doing in life.”  

“I mean,” Lowe said, raising a hand, “technically I didn’t kill it—”  

Everyone in the corridor turned to stare at him. “Okay, yes, I did. But only after it tried to kill me first.”  

Neither of the two were impressed. The first one shrugged, “Uh-huh. Well, it’s not our problem. Not our godsdamned problem at all. Lant will have a report for you soon.” They vanished, leaving Lowe and Rook in the corridor. Then, without further warning, Lowe’s entire world broke open.  

And it wasn’t subtle. It was like his skull was wrenched open at the seams, and the whole universe was shoved inside. 

Suddenly, everything was too much.  

The hospital corridor stretched, deepened and unfolded into infinite detail. In a blink of an eye, Lowe could see individual fibres in the floor tiles and microscopic cracks in the paint on the walls. All around him heat signatures were radiating from the people around him, through the coffee cup left behind by the orderly was warmer than Rook.

A clock ticked inside a room four doors down suddenly became the loudest fucking sound in all of Lowe’s world.  

A breath.  

Someone inhaled three rooms away.  

Another exhaled.  

Another.  

Another.  

The entire heartbeat of the hospital rushed in and out. An intricate, chaotic symphony of motion and sound and life and—  

And—  

And—  

Lowe’s knees buckled as the sensory overload threatened to swamp him, but Rook caught him before he hit the floor. “What the fuck, Jana?”  

Lowe didn’t hear him. Well, he did, but he was too busy drowning in raw input to give the words any especial attention. The sudden increase in his Perception - not just a hundred points, but moving into Level 2 - was proving to be a lot. Every single one of those extra points was screaming for his attention.  

His brain—his very high-Intelligence, very high-Wisdom brain—was doing its best to process everything, but just for the moment, everything was too fast. He was seeing everything too thoroughly.  

The weirdest analogy popped into his head, and he grasped on to it. Anything to distract him from the noise. And the sights. And the smells. For the first time in his life, Lowe thought he truly understood what it meant to be a spider.  

To feel the vibration of every footstep in the building. To hear the static charge flicker between mana-powered lights. To smell lingering traces of every conversation that had passed through the hall in the last hour—coffee, mana, the weirdly floral scent of someone’s shampoo, the Shimmerskin’s blood.

It was too much.  

“Jana? Jana! What the fuck is going on?”  

“Make it stop!”  

“Make what stop?”  

“All of it.”  

Rook narrowed his eyes. “Hold on. You levelled up, didn’t you?”  

Lowe made a noise that might have been agreement or suffering. Hard to tell.  

“What did you do?”

Lowe managed to form his mouth into the right shape to make some words. “Perception. Lots of it.”  

“Perc - Okay. Well, yes. That was fucking stupid, wasn’t it? Let me guess, your brain’s trying to perceive literally everything.”  

“YES!”  

“Sucks to be you,” Rook said, patting him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, it’ll settle. You’ve just got a bit of altitude sickness right now. It’ll fade.”

Lowe groaned, pressing his palms into his temples. His skull was buzzing. Every cell in his body was too aware. He needed to— Then, just as Rook had said it would,  his Wisdom and Intelligence kicked in, and sheer mental horsepower slammed into overdrive as the need for him to retain his sanity. He felt his mind begin to categorise everything he was experiencing.  

Step one: Prioritise immediate threats. None. (if the epic stink eye Staffen was throwing his way didn’t count as an imminent threat to life . . .)

Step two: Sort sensory information by relevance: Way too much of it.  

Step three: Fucking filter it!  

Okay. Okay, he could do this. Lowe focused on individual sensations. On learning them. He catalogued the flickering of the manalights, the scent-trails of the passing Orderlies, the whispered breath of a Nurse in the next hallway, and the distant vibrations of a leyline running beneath the floor. Lowe found himself naming them. Boxing them. Organised them like a filing cabinet, until his mind could start dismissing the unnecessary noise.  

Slowly—painfully—his senses began to adjust.  

After what felt like an eternity, Lowe felt himself able to straighten out. The world was still too sharp, but at least it was no longer crushing him to death.  

“You good, Jana?”  

Lowe took a moment.  

Listened.  

Watched.  

Saw the faint tremors in Rook’s fingers—the way his body was still tensed from what he had needed to do in order to get into Coda’s mind.

Saw the Orderlies at the far end of the corridor, pausing just long enough outside a supply room before moving on, as if making sure no one was watching.  

Saw the tiny, almost imperceptible flicker in the manalights along the corridor. An energy shift that, if he really focused, he figured he could trace back to the manawell beneath the hospital.  

Saw—  

He swallowed.  

“Yeah,” he said. “I’m good.”  

“You sure, Jana? Because for about two minutes there, you looked like you were about to vibrate out of your own fucking skull.”  

“Fuck off, Rook. I’m okay.”

“But feeling extra perceptive, right?”  

“Yes. In fact, I just perceived that you’re a wanker.”  

Rook clapped a hand on his shoulder, the impact vibrating up and down his body. “Welcome to your new nightmare, Inspector.”  

Lowe sighed. This was going to take some getting used to.

                They’d swung by to pick up Latham before heading across the city for a follow up visit to Sovereign Bank HQ. Maybe it was all Lowe’s extra points in Perception, but the way he figured it was that if they had any hope of getting ahead of this mess, the Warden of the Reserve seemed like the most obvious nut they had available to crack.  

As the other two escorted him—Lowe was keeping his eyes shut to avoid being flattened by the onslaught of new sensations—Rook filled them in on what he’d managed to wrench from Coda’s spirit. It was less than inspiring.

"I was able to determine precious little, I’m afraid," Rook said. "The potions they’ve got him on in there have his spirit pretty much completely spaced. Honestly, I think he’d be easier to interrogate dead than he was back there."  

"In case you’re wondering, little man," Latham muttered, "I’m finding your friend really creepy."  

"One man’s creepy is another’s useful resource when questioning the nearly dead. Tomatoes, tomatoes."  

Lowe cracked an eye open, nearly threw up, and squeezed them shut again. Even the noise of Soar was too much. "Can you two stop bickering for a second?" he said. "There’s only so much I can concentrate on at once, right now. You must have got something out of him, Rook?"  

"Sure. But it was mostly emotional impressions and general vibes. Nothing very concrete or clear. I can tell you that he is wallowing  in a lot of guilt. And he seems to be reliving the Black Knight murders over and over. I don’t have anything for you that would stand up before the Council, but it was definitely him doing the . . . you know, stuff, with Cenorth directing traffic." Rook hesitated. "I’ll tell you what, though."  

"What?" Lowe asked.  

"I don’t think he saw what happened in the park coming. If there’s one emotion stronger than all the guilt, it’s rage. Rage towards the boss. He’s pretty certain Cenorth was the one to ice him."  

Lowe chewed on that for a moment. "I mean, that makes sense, doesn’t it? If the boss betrayed him, I can see why he’d be more than a little pissed. I mean, what did he think was going to happen that day? If he was the Black Knight, he had to know nobody was actually coming to collect Highberg’s ransom."  

Lowe felt Rook shrug. "No idea, Jana. But for what it’s worth, I don’t think he expected us all to be wiped."  

"That’s not worth all that much to me, to be honest" Lowe said. "You?"  

There was a pause. "No. Not much to me either." 

"Sorry to interrupt this sentimental trip down memory lane," Latham cut in, yanking Lowe to the right to avoid a pothole in the pavement, "but did your little hospital excursion actually accomplish anything? Other than, currently, making the little man an even bigger liability than he was previously?"  

"Well," Lowe said, "we flushed out another Shimmerskin. That’s not nothing. And I’m not an ‘even bigger liability’. I’m just taking a moment to adjust to a new and awesome power."

“I don’t know about anyone else, but when I get a new Skill, I tend not to need to be dragged around Soar like a bucket of shit until I acclimatise. I’m struggling to see the net-benefit of this version of you, right now. Would it not just be best if me and the undead dropped you off at home and cracked on ourselves?”

“Technically, I’m not ‘undead’. As I didn’t actually die, I’m more of a revenant than your classic undead.”

“I so don’t fucking care. What about it, Lowe? Take you to Mylaf for coffee and crumpets until you properly manage to adjust?”

“No,” Lowe said, trying to stand up a bit straighter under his own steam. “I think once I get a handle on this it’s going to be useful. And I absolutely need to be there when we talk to Morholt again.”

“I don’t completely disagree with Jana,” Rook said. “But I’m having all sorts of worries about how this shape-changing OOB squad knew we were going to the hospital. I didn’t notice anyone following us - and I was keeping a more than careful eye - which suggests . . .”

"Which suggests, considering the rest of our group were ambushed - albeit crappily - we’ve got all kinds of surveillance issues right now," Latham finished  

Lowe thought back to what Arkola had put in that notification about not being able to speak freely in its own Temple. If the supreme being in Soar couldn’t guarantee they weren’t being overheard, what chance did they have? And, yeah, he was pretty sure they were being monitored.

But that was a problem for another time, because Lowe was suddenly dragged to a halt. He carefully cracked open an eye and girded his loins. They were at their destination. 

***

“I honestly don’t know what else I can tell you," Morholt wheezed, his jowls trembling with each breath. 

The Warden of the Reserve dabbed at his glistening forehead with a silk handkerchief, though it did little against the damp sheen of sweat pooling in the folds of his skin. "The Vault suffered a significant—and might I add, entirely unexpected—security breach. The kind of breach that should not be possible, not with the precautions that we have in place. And yet, here we are.” His lips pursed in wounded indignation, his beady eyes darting between them as if expecting sympathy. None came. "I reached out to Cuckoo House because I was assured—assured, mind you!—that you people knew how to handle situations like this. That discretion and efficiency were your hallmarks. And yet, and yet—” He wheezed, shaking his head, pressing a pudgy hand to his chest as though the betrayal was physically painful. “I must say, I am profoundly disappointed to hear that you are no closer to recovering that which was stolen nor apprehending the individual responsible."  If you discover this tale on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.

His lower lip quivered and, for a moment, Lowe thought the man was about to cry. "Nor," he added, voice climbing in pitch, "have you managed to ascertain who butchered my employees like cattle! Do you have any idea the logistical nightmare this has been for me? The paperwork alone—" He let out a strangled noise, somewhere between a sob and a gasp, as if the sheer enormity of his administrative woes might be enough to bring on his scheduled heart attack.  

"Yeah. That does seem like a bit of an issue," Lowe said, forcing himself to keep his focus on Morholt’s face so that all the other myriad of things pulling at his attention in the office didn’t distract him. The problem was, his newly buffed Perception simply didn’t want to cooperate. If he wasn’t absolutely committed to where he was looking, his gaze kept snagging on details he’d never have noticed before, each one demanding a slice of his attention.  

The hairline crack running down the far wall, so fine it was nearly invisible—except for the way dust had settled into it, marking it out like a fault line waiting to split.  

The subtle click-click of a loose ceiling manablade, half a second out of sync with the rest, the irregular rhythm making his teeth itch.  

And the faintest smear of something dark and dried beneath Morholt’s heavy wooden desk, barely visible unless you were really looking. Or had a newly ranked-up Perception attribute. Blood? Ink? Whatever it was, someone had tried to wipe it away but hadn't done a good enough job.  

With a colossal effort, Lowe dragged his focus back to Morholt. However, that sort of intense scrutiny wasn’t ideal when the subject in question was so physically repellent. Unfortunately, Lowe’s expanded Perception didn’t come with any sort of filter. Every pore, every ingrown hair, every bead of sweat rolling down the wattle of Morholt’s neck  . . . it was all there in ultra excruciating, high-definition clarity. A lesser man might have gagged.  

Still, Lowe was realising there was a considerable upside to all this. Along with the horrifying level of detail, Lowe was fairly certain he could see when the man was lying. Not just suspect it. Know it. The little hesitations. The micro-expressions. The way Morholt’s eyes darted half a second too late to be convincing. It was like Lowe’s brain had started running some internal truth-detection wetware, flagging every half-truth and omission in real-time. He didn’t think he was about to put Arebella out of business anytime soon—her Skills were clearly leagues ahead of a little PErception buffing—but it was nice to have an edge. 

Even if it meant having to look at this . . . blob in such grotesque detail. He wondered whether Arkola had suggested the Progress Point dump for just this reason? But he dismissed the thought. He could go mad trying to second-guess that god.

“Where’s your PA gone?” Rook asked from his left.

As Morholt turned to look at the Threshold Guardian, Lowe noticed the tell-tale frown which he was coming to recognise meant the man was about to lie. “Miss St Clair called in sick today.”

“Really?” Latham said from Lowe’s other side. “And you spoke to her, did you?”

“I did. First thing this morning. Women’s problems, apparently.”

Lowe thought that was a pretty generous way of describing the torn remains of a body they’d left in the basement of the Temple. It didn’t take much truth-telling ability to tell that Morholt was speaking out of his very generous arse. Rook had obviously noticed that too.

“Tell me, Warden. Has your PA been with you long?”

“A few years (lie). She was recommended to me by a colleague (lie). I felt I needed to shake things up a little in my staff and Miss St Clair’s resume suggested she would be just the ticket. (lie). But I must say, I fail to see why the personnel arrangements in my office are of interest to an Inspector in the Security Services (lie).”

Lowe looked at the stain on the floor again. He really did think it was a bloodstain . . . “Have you ever had cause to employ an OOB squad to work for the bank?”

“OOB squad?”  

“Out of Bounds,” Latham said. “Assassins. Unofficial problem-solvers. Off-the-books bastards. The kind of people you send when you don’t want a problem solved so much as erased. You get the picture? It is entirely illegal for them to operate within Soar, in case you did not know that. Treasonous, apparently. And I’m told that on very good legal authority.”

“Well, I for one have never heard of a . . . Out of Bounds squad.  (Big, fat, sweating LIE)”

Lowe moved forward, much to Morholt’s disquiet and knelt down to touch the stain on the floor, beneath the heavy wooden desk. His new Perception rendered it in excruciating clarity. It had seeped deep into the grain, the wood darkened and swollen around the edges. It wasn’t exactly fresh—no gloss, no stickiness—but it hadn’t had time to fully settle either. The colour had turned that particular shade between rust and old wine, and there were small ridges where the liquid had clotted, like the broken surface of a dried-out riverbed. 

Whoever had bled here had done so in earnest. And reasonably recently.  

For a moment, that detail consumed his attention. But then something shifted in his peripheral vision, something bigger, something more wrong.  

From his current angle, Lowe could now see past the feet of the desk. Behind the desk. And there, slumped unnaturally against the carved mahogany panels, was Morholt. His eyes bulged, mouth frozen in an unfinished plea, a congealing rivulet of blood trailing from his slack lips. His corpulent frame had been dumped like so much discarded meat, the vastness of him crammed between desk and chair in a way that made it obvious—this hadn’t been quick.  

Slowly and deliberately, Lowe looked upwards at the figure seated above him.  

The - well, at least ‘a’ - Warden of the Reserve met his gaze, then sighed. His shape rippled, the details of Morholt’s sweat-slicked face unraveling, reforming into something else entirely.  

"You just don’t know when to give up, do you?"

            







	***





                Latham moved first.  

Which, to be fair, was exactly what you wanted from a man of his Class and Level. There was no hesitation, no warning, just pure, unfiltered, surround-sound violence as he lunged at the Shimmerskin with all the enthusiasm of a battering ram introduced to a particularly offensive door.  

Unfortunately, the door in question turned out to, apparently, be made of liquid mercury. And malice. Lots and lots of malice.  

Lowe barely had time to register the blur of movement before a foot—a perfectly normal foot, except it belonged to a man who, up until a second ago, had been Morholt and appeared from within that figure’s backside—connected with him and launched him bodily across the room. He heard the initial crunch. And, boy, was it a wet one. Which was then followed by a much louder thwack as he hit the wall with very little grace at all.

Now, Lowe had always been the sort of person who tried to find the silver lining in a situation (lie). The problem was, that lining was currently being stretched painfully thin over the absolutely catastrophic amount of information his new Perception was providing about what had just happened to his spine. For one thing, he now knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that backs were not supposed to bend in that direction. For another, he was now explicitly aware that there were an astonishing number of nerves apparently involved in the whole staying upright process, and they had all decided, as one, to go on strike.  

Also, as it turned out, he was intimately aware of the exact moment Roll With The Punches kicked in because suddenly, his vertebrae were knitting themselves back together in real time, and that was not an experience he ever wanted to be conscious for again. In fact, he was looking back on the times that a solid, if unspectacular, right hand would send him off to the land of Nod as a golden age. There was a lot to be said for blessed unconsciousness while Roll with the Punches did its thing. 

Meanwhile, Latham and Rook were getting into it with the Shimmerskin and, disappointingly, it did not seem that was as much one-way traffic as might have been hoped.

Rook moved with that smooth, effortless grace that only came with being both very dead and also post Level 50. He didn’t dodge so much as wasn’t there when fists tried to meet his face, flowing around blows like he’d been poured into the air rather than walking through it. Latham, by contrast, fought like someone who had absolutely no intention of avoiding damage. Because what kind of Level ?? wuss tried to avoided damage? He took hits, shrugged them off, and kept coming, all raw, overwhelming force pressing upon the Shimmerskin with the relentless inevitability of a collapsing star.  

And yet, despite the fact that between them they had the speed, skill, and sheer unreasonableness to put most threats down in under a minute, their target was more than holding his own.  

More than that, Lowe thought from his semi-recumbent position, he actually appeared to be keeping them at bay.  

Every time Rook tried to grab him, the assassin’s arms just weren’t there anymore. Instead, they were replaced by something thinner, longer and eminently ungraspable. Every time Latham was poised to land a blow, his target was already morphing, muscle and bone shifting into something that could absorb the impact, and redirect the force of the strike away. And always just enough to stop it from doing any real damage.  

It looked to Lowe like his friends were fighting someone made of smoke, mirrors and silly putty.

Latham, clearly fed up, activated something dramatic, and glowing alarmingly, drove a haymaker towards the Shimmerskin’s head. Lowe shuddered to think what would have happened should the blow have connected - they really did need this guy alive, after all. Instead, though, the man’s face just wasn’t there anymore as a thickly muscled arm, now twice the size it should have been, caught Latham’s wrist mid-swing and twisted. The crack of bone was enough to make Lowe wince. He didn’t think he’d ever seen anyone properly hurt Latham.

At the same time, Rook—who had evidently decided that fair fights were for suckers—went for the legs, aiming to take their opponent off balance. Except, at that precise moment, the Shimmerskin didn’t have legs anymore. Not human ones, at least. And then he’d pivoted to move Latham in the way of the assault.

There was a blur of movement, a thump, and then—  

Lowe blinked.  

Latham and Rook were sitting on the floor, both looking considerably worse for wear.  

And the Shimmerskin was still standing. 

Then he sighed. Clapped his hands together and then said. “Look, guys, shall we just take a beat for a moment? I think we’ve probably got some things to talk about.”  This tale has been unlawfully lifted from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.

There were a few moments of silence.  

Lowe, still half-convinced that every single bone in his body was more of a suggestion than a working framework, looked at Latham. Latham looked at Rook. Rook looked back at Lowe. They all gave the smallest of nods. Finally, Lowe sighed, stood and dusted himself off.  

"I mean, sure," he said. "I think I speak for us all when I say we're open to a brief chat."  

***

Considering this was the second time in not really all that long at all that Drefleck had smashed Lowe to pieces against a wall, it was probably unsurprising he was finding it hard to warm to the assassin. Of course, as it looked like the Shimmerskin could probably kill them all if he had wanted, he didn’t think his personal seal of approval was going to be all that important in the grand scheme of things.

“First things first, it’s important you know that none of this has been anything personal,” the Shimmerskin said.

“Oh, that’s okay then. Sorry for taking offence at the, you know, consistent murder attempts. Now you’ve said ‘sorry’, I don’t know what I was thinking getting pissed about the whole thing!” Lowe really wasn’t feeling the love towards this guy.

“Look, you can be as sniffy as you want, but a job’s a job. One of the first things you learn in this game is that you have to leave your morals at the door. Come on! It’s not like I’m the only one of us who sometimes gets given orders he’s not wild about. Your missus-” he jerked his head at Latham- “she’ll tell you the score.” he said to Latham.

The Temple Warder was still sitting on the floor, looking more than usually furious. Lowe made a private note never to do anything to make Latham look at him like that. It wasn’t so much that he was giving a look that could kill as much as one that Lowe assumed would achieve a sizeable bloodline genocide. “You mention Hel again, and it’ll be the last thing you ever say.”

Drefleck shrugged - which was weird as it wasn’t so much as his shoulders moved as the whole of his torso transformed until it was just a touch higher. This did not endear him to anyone else in the room. “As you wish. I’m just saying. Orders are orders. And contracts and contracts. I don’t want us to get off on the wrong foot, here. Everything that has happened has been strictly business.”

“Well, while we’re being all magnanimous and shit,” Rook said, “I’m assuming we’re also ‘no harm, no fouling’ all of your mates we’ve fucked up over the last few days. Because, let me tell you, some of those bitches squealed as they died.”

If Drefleck was bothered to hear about the violent demise of his squadmates, he didn’t show it. “No skin off my nose. And when a Shimmerskin says that, you can take it to the bank,” he smiled at that. “Which, now I think of it, is quite an unfortunate phrase considering how all this started. Look, right now, I’m up for a truce. My boys made our move, and it didn’t stick. As far as I’m concerned, turnaround is fair play. We took our shot, we missed, and you gave my guys a shellacking. That’s the way it goes.”

“Well, that’s very fucking philanthropic of you,” Latham said. 

Drefleck made the strange shrugging gesture again. “It is what it is. Incidentally, the only body I’ve not been able to recover is Synchler. I don’t suppose . . .”

“Dead,” Rook said.

“You sure? You’d be surprised what a Shimmerskin can bounce back from.”

“Trust us. That guy’s bouncing days are well and truly over.”

There was a beat. “Fair enough. Shame, he was good.”  Then his expression stuttered, flickering through a range of emotions like a deck of cards shuffled too fast - amusement, irritation, something like sorrow - Each belonged to a slightly different face, as if he hadn’t quite decided which version of himself was supposed to be here.  

“Okay, so here’s where we’re at,” Drefleck said, rocking back on his heels. “I’ve been paid a considerable sum of money to kill you.” He aimed a finger at Lowe, like a magician setting up the prestige. “Me and my boys have given it the old college try, but you’ve proved more than a little . . . resistant. Now, after I heard you’d walked away from being burned alive, I checked our contract, and I reckon you having some sort of bullshit resurrection Skill goes beyond the scope of the agreement. I did kill you, didn’t I?”  

Lowe couldn’t help but feel this was one of the strangest conversations he had ever been in. And he’d recently been in discussion with a god. “You did. Sorry it didn’t stick.”

Drefleck waved the comment away. “Hey, not your fault. We each plough our own furrow, don’t we? But it is an interesting ethical point, is it not? At what stage can it be said we’ve fulfilled our professional responsibilities? We were paid to kill you, and you died. Some may consider that ‘job done.’”

Latham stood, slowly, and Lowe could tell he activated all sorts of Skills as he did so. Apparently, Drefleck noticed it too as he triggered a bunch of his own in response. “Yeah, I’m not too interested in discussing the finer points of ethics. We done with all the chat, yet?”

“Dial it down a notch, big guy. I said I wanted to talk, and I do.”

“How about we restart the conversation with you spilling who paid you to kill Lowe?”

“Nah, not that kind of chat,” Drefleck waggled a finger back and forth. The fact that it grew out of the centre of his forehead was neither here nor there. “My reputation can take the hit for not keeping you dead - as I say, I think as case can we made we’re owed 100% of our fee there -  but not from telling tales out of school. I might not have much of a squad left right now,  but considering how much we’ve been paid. I’m sure I can pick myself up and start again somewhere else.  It’s not like my set of Skills are ever going out of fashion., is it? And, I’ll tell you what, it’s going to be a cold day in Arkola’s basement before we’re lured to work in Soar again.”

“Okay. So if you’re not planning on telling us that, what is it you’re all so keen to share?”

“Well, first of all, I’d like to share some thoughts I have over a certain job that went very, very south. And, in particular,” Drefleck looked down on the body of Morholt, “the wankers who apparently think we fucked the whole thing up and have witheld the final installment.”

“Okay,” Rook said, also standing and taking - Lowe noticed - a position opposite Latham with Drefleck in between them. Lowe could be wrong, but he didn’t think Round 2 was going to go quite as well for the Shimmerskin as the first bout. “Well, that all sounds very interesting. And the second thing?”

“Well, this is where I think you’re really going to want to chinwag. You see, I was wondering if either of you two had spoken to your  . . . little ladies recently?”

            







	***





                "I'd like it formally noted, for the record and posterity, that out of all of us,  I was the only one who kept my head just there," Latham said. "And considering I have something of a reputation for smiting first and asking questions only when it's time to file the mortuary paperwork, I believe that entitles me to—at the very least—a pat on the head. Maybe even a commendation. Or a biscuit. Definitely a biscuit."

Lowe pulled one of Mylaf’s cookies out of his inventory and, wincing, threw it to Latham. His hand was sore from where, following activating Slugger, he’d planted the biggest punch of his life onto Drefleck’s jaw. Apparently, his supercharged Perception let him pick just the right spot to render the Shimmerskin unconscious.

As Roll with the Punches was busy reconstructing the stump on the end of his arm, Lowe took a breath. “What do you think he meant ‘have you spoken to your little ladies recently?’”

"I don’t know, little man. Let’s ask him. Oh, wait! We can’t right now because you’ve just knocked him out. Fantastic work. Really top-notch problem-solving," Latham said, pulling a Sending Stone from his pocket and pressing it to his lips.  

"Hel, you there? Hel?"  

Silence.  

"Hel, if you’re screening your calls, you better believe me that now is not the time. This is more important than you going dark. You’re going to need to answer me. I need a status update."  

Still nothing.  

Lowe watched Latham carefully, trying to get his own worry under control. He wasn’t panicking. Not yet. That would be stupid. There were all sorts of reasons Hel might not be able to answer Latham right now. Of course, none of them were good, but still. He pulled out his own stone and pushed mana into it.  

"Bella? It’s Lowe. Pick up, please."  

More silence. That seemed to be catching.

"Arebella," he said, more forcefully this time. "If you’re quiet because you and Hel got into a drinking contest and she’s currently passed out under a table, I will forgive you, and we will never speak of it again. Just say something so I know you’re okay. I’m sure we have all sorts of listening Skills aimed at us right now, but this is more important than subterfuge. I need to know you’re okay."  

The stone remained stubbornly, damningly quiet.  

Latham and he exchanged looks.

“I mean, this doesn’t necessarily entail anything bad has happened to them . . .” Rook was pale. Paler. 

“Shit.” Latham popped the first stone he’d used back in his pocket and took out another one. This one was darkly red. "Tenia," he said. "Please tell me you’re there."  

A pause. Then—  

"Latham?" Tenia’s voice was wary. "How do you know to use this mana frequency?”

“Hel left me some instructions in the event of her being . . . unavailable.” 

“Okay, then you’ll know the codeword, right?”

“Tenia, I don’t have time . . .”

“Codeword, or the Sending Stone you are holding will transform into a small but determinedly psychotic demon,” the Nightmare Reaver said. “If Hel gave you these details, she’d have told you the codeword. And if not . . . well, I’m sure she’ll forgive me. Eventually.”

Latham turned away from the others, and dropped his voice, but Lowe’s insane Perception still - just about - caught the whispered words. “Moist Weasel.”

"Fucking hell, Latham. You gave me a start! Is everything okay?”

“Yeah, sorry for the intrusion, but I need to know if Hel’s with you, Charl and Irek."  

There was a beat of silence, then a neutral. "No. Why would she be?"  

Latham shut his eyes for a moment. "So she’s not there? Didn’t turn up, unexpectedly, a day or so back?"  

"Of course she’s not fucking here. If she was, don’t you think she’d have told you? What’s going on? Has she left you or something?"     

"No. Nothing like that. I’ve just lost track of her, that’s all. Oh, I don’t suppose Arebella’s available?"  

"What? Lowe’s better half? No, she’s not here either. You’re worrying me here.”

"Everything’s fine. Just checking in."  

"You never check in."  

"Trying something new," Latham said, already tucking the stone back away. "Give my love to the rest of the gang." Then he turned back to Lowe. "Fuck."

“Fuck,” Lowe agreed, turning to Rook. “You said Hel came to you after all the . . . unpleasantness and wanted you to leave Soar with her. That you refused, and she took off.”  This tale has been unlawfully lifted without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.

“That’s right. She came knocking just after I’d got back to the graveyard after dropping my attackers. She said the rest of them had been attacked to, that things were getting too hot and that I should come with them. It sounded like she was on her way to the Temple next.”  

“Why didn’t you go?”  

“I don’t do group activities, Jana. You know that. And I especially don’t do them since a member of my last team got me killed. All it takes is one idiot tripping over a chamber pot in the dark, and suddenly, the whole safehouse is compromised. As I said to her, no, thank you very much.”  

“It’s not like Hel to take ‘no’ for an answer,” Latham said. “In fact, that doesn’t sound much like Hel at all.” 

“Oh?” Rook tilted his head. “Which part?”

“The part where she goes politely knocking on tombs mid-crisis. She’s more a blow the fucking doors off kind of gal. Also the part where she asks, you say ‘no’ and she doesn’t just drag you along, whether you liked it or not. Again, she’s not one of life’s acceptors. Oh, and the part where she didn’t tell me she was going to head for the hills in the first place.”  

Lowe didn’t like where this was going. But Hel grabbing the others and going to ground wasn’t exactly out of character for the Wind Tyrant. She was the kind of operative who made plans within plans. And she wasn’t the sort to ask people if they’d like to cooperate. If she thought Rook needed to get the fuck out of Soar, she’d have made it happen before he had time to refuse.  

Something itched at the back of his mind.  

“What can I say?” Rook said. “She knew I wasn’t going to change my mind. Maybe she figured her odds were better without me slowing her down. And I’m a Threshold Guardian. You’ve got to know there’s a hard limit to what she was going to be able to do to me.”  

“And you’re sure it was her?” Latham asked.  

There was a moment’s pause as they both looked at the Shimmerskin on the floor. And then over to the body of Morholt. 

“Fuck!” Rook said. “I see what you’re getting at. I assumed it was her. But now that we’re saying it out loud . . .” He grimaced. “Shit.”  

“Shimmerskin?” Lowe asked Latham. “That’s the trick matey boy down there pulled on me. Pretended to be Hel and asked me to meet him.”

“You know what that means though, don’t you, little man?”

“Bella. Hel, Karolen and Ortel. They’re not in hiding. They’re not in a safehouse. Someone took them. And it sounds very much like someone who can change their shape did it.”

But before Lowe could press further, there was a groan from behind him. Drefleck was waking up. The Shimmerskin stirring, his shifting features flickering through half a dozen faces before settling on something unpleasantly amused.  

“Now,” Drefleck rasped, “where were we?”

***

Latham picked Drefleck off the floor and smashed him down on Morholt’s desk. The heavy wood groaned at the impact and the desk cracked. It appeared the Shimmerskin’s earlier ability to resist the Temple Warder’s attacks had long since passed.  

When he spoke, Latham’s voice was a terrifying growl. The sort of noise Lowe’s ancestors might have heard in the dark back in the time they lived in caves and had just discovered fire. “Where is she? What the fuck have you done with her?”  

Drefleck barely had time to wheeze out a single syllable before Latham’s fist crashed down into his face. Then another. And another.  Lowe watched as Latham kept going, raining blows down like he was chiseling his way through a quarry. Drefleck’s skull snapped back, his ribs folded under and his mouth—if what remained could be called that—spat out something wet and not entirely human.  

"Latham!" Lowe shouted, but the Temple Warder didn’t so much as pause. "Latham, that’s enough!" Lowe tried to catch his friend's wrist mid-swing and was pulled off his feet. Then Rook was there, adding his weight to proceedings and the two of them, barely, managed to haul Latham back before he destroyed what was left of Drefleck’s uncooperative shape.  

Latham resisted—hard. But then he relented, his breathing ragged and his shoulders heaving with something worse than rage. He wanted to keep going, but his strength met their combined weight, and in the end, he let them pull him away.  

For a moment, the only sound was the wet slap of Latham’s fists clenching and unclenching.  

Drefleck lay sprawled on the ruined desk, a mess of bruises, shattered bones, and something that should have been blood but oddly wasn’t. He twitched, a half-breath leaving him like a punctured bellows.  Then, he shivered.  

And that was when things got weird.  

The bones he’d broken? They unbroke, the skin rolling and shifting like something alive underneath it. His ribs reformed as if the damage had never happened, only it was too fast, the process too visible. This wasn’t healing - nothing like Lowe’s Roll with the Punches, this was a Shimmerskin simply picking a new body.  

Defleck’s fingers moved and the whole of him contracted as his muscles regrew and his bones clicked unnaturally into new places, hair changing and his flesh twisting. Then, suddenly—horribly—Hel was lying on the desk.  

And it was indespuilty her. From her pale eyes, her knowing grin, to her face framed by braids, looking up at them with an expression that was eerily detached from the nightmare happening in real-time.  

Latham made a sound—one Lowe had never heard before. Then Drefleck’s features rippled again, his eyes rolling, body convulsing until with a final lurch, he snapped back into himself. He let out a slow breath, smoothed down his tunic, and tilted his head, a smile tugging at his still-healing lips.  

"Look, I've already said I want to talk about things," he said. "You’re the guys who keep throwing hands!"  

"So, where are they?!" Lowe and Latham said at the same time. 

"Oh, now you’re interested in dialogue!" He adjusted his sleeves with deliberate slowness, seemingly savoring their fury like a fine wine. “Well, tough shit. I was trying to be all conciliatory and you guys have responded by being complete dicks. So, no. Freebies are now off the table.” He leaned back slightly, stretching as though he’d just had a refreshing nap rather than a near-death experience. “We’re going to do this my way. I’ll tell things my way and then, if you’re very good, I might get around to share what I know about the missing. Or you can just fucking get on with killing me. See if I care.”  

Latham let out a wordless roar and drove his fist into the nearest wall. Plaster cracked, dust rained down, and for a moment, it was as if the entire room had held its breath.  But, clearly, the release he was looking for wasn’t there. There was nothing to fight - nothing to smash - that was going to make any of this any easier. His was a hollow, impotent fury, and, what is more, Drefleck knew it. 

“Well,” he said, “that was all very manly indeed! Consider me suitably cowed.”

“Tell your story,” Lowe said. “But make it quick. And if it turns out you’re hurt them . . .”

“No more of that,” Drefleck said, waving the words away. “Now, if you’re sitting comfortably, I’ll begin. Picture the scene. It’s a few days ago, and my boys are in the Vault . . ."

            







	***





                Drefleck paused and cast a languid look at the three men still bristling in front of him. “You know,” he said, “I’ve taken some beatings in my time. Occupational hazard, as I’m sure you’ll appreciate. But I don’t think I’ve ever been pummelled quite so enthusiastically by someone who genuinely believed it would do any good.” 

Latham made another angry sound, but Drefleck held up a hand. 

“No, no. I’m not looking to start anything. It was just an observation. I do so love a committed professional.” He gestured vaguely to himself. “You know, when all is said and done, we’re not so different, you and me.”

“Fuck you!” Lowe said.

Drefleck briefly took on Arebella’s shape. “If you think that would make things better?” Then he switched back to his nondescript form. “But no more of that, let’s get to the part where I tell you something useful and, perhaps, we reach a bit more of an understanding of our negotiating positions. You’re not going to like what I have to say, mind, but that’s not really my problem.” 

He stretched out his fingers, watching them shift and settle back into their preferred shape. 

“As I’m sure you’ve realised, my boys and I are an OOB. Not exactly one of the household names, but in certain circles, we’d built ourselves a decent reputation. A reputation for being able to pull off some pretty fucking specialist work. 

“You see, when most OOBs are hired, you’ll be getting a group of people who do one job very well. Maybe they kill someone for you. Maybe a whole host of someones. Maybe they steal something that can’t be stolen. Maybe they rough up a few sorry bastards to send a message. Different strokes for different folks, and you can usually find a squad that’ll scratch what itches you. But my lot?” He grinned. “We’re all Shimmerskins. It’s our USP. We aren’t assassins. Well, we’re not just assassins. We’re complete replacements.”

He let that word sit in the air for a moment. Watching it curdle. 

“More often than not, when people reach for the old OOB directory, they’re looking for a government sponsored hit squad. Shoot first, ask questions later, you get me? It’s actually pretty rare for someone to need an entire operation turned inside out, with thirty-odd people swapped for ringers, but when they do—well, that’s when me and my boys get the call.” 

Rook frowned at that. “You’re saying people paid you to just—what? Walk in, take someone’s face, and pretend nothing has changed?” 

“I mean, sure. You’re making it sound pretty facile. But yes. It’s exactly that. That’s what we specialise in,” Drefleck said. “Why kill off a whole organisation when you can just become it for a time and put it to use? That takes a fuckton of prep work, mind. You can’t just swap out the front desk and expect everything to tick along nicely without everyone being exceptionally well briefed so noone suspects a thing. When we’re required to move in, we committed to the piece.

“Take the Sable Accord down Nellington way. Nasty little operation, built its fortune on off-the-books Mercenary contracts and the occasional act of enthusiastic piracy. Now, the client—who shall remain nameless, but let’s just say they had a vested interest in seeing less of that particular enterprise—decided a scorched-earth approach would be pretty inefficient. You know the saying, you cut one dick off a thousand others grow in its place. So instead of calling in a hit squad to level the organisation, we were paid to take over and remodel it. 

"Three months. That’s all it took. One by one, key players were removed and replaced. The Administrators. The Enforcers. The Handlers. When my boys were done, the whole damn thing was still standing, still signing contracts, still running jobs—only now, it was working for the people who paid us instead of its original owners. An no one was any the wiser.” 

“That’s insane,” Lowe said. 

“Oh, undoubtedly it is,” Drefleck agreed. “It’s also exceptionally lucrative. The kind of thing only the wealthiest, most paranoid of governments ever commission. And, don’t get me wrong, it doesn’t happen often. Far too expensive and labour intensive for most people to countenance. Usually, people just want one target replaced—a Noble, a Merchant, a Commander. But for the full works?” He whistled. “That’s reserved for when you really need to hit the reset button on an institution.

“There was another job. Back in Arvenstadt. The Crown Prince, no less, thought his inner circle might not be so inner anymore, if you catch my drift. Foreign interests. Political rivals. He didn’t trust anyone. But—and here’s the funny bit—he didn’t want to get rid of them. That would make too much noise. He just wanted them . . . better.” 

He spread his hands. 

“So, in we went. Seven of us. Just seven. Over the course of six weeks, we picked them off one by one. We learned their patterns, their quirks. We became them. And at the end of it? The Prince had the same advisors, the same confidants—only now, they were all working in his best interests.” He grinned. “I hear the country’s doing very well these days.” 

“And how many times have you pulled this shit in Soar?” Rook said.

“Never. Not once. Far too much like hard work. For one thing, the political scene here is a goddamn knife fight in a burning alley. And I don’t know about you, but I prefer my investments to last longer than it takes a fucking god to take an interest. Besides, Soar’s got its own style of corruption. I imagine hiring us to move in would be admitting they weren’t good enough at betraying each other the old-fashioned way.” 

 “So what changed?” Lowe said. “Why are you running around here now?” Stolen content warning: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.

“Well, it’s hard to keep you head about such things when Soar Sovereign Fucking Bank gets in touch.”

***

The way Drefleck told it, it was actually all pretty simple. 

The Warden of the Reserve had something in the Vault he’d suddenly become very worried someone was after. Despite its reputation for being impregnable, he had reason to think his own security might not be up to the task. So, via various intermediaries, he reached out to an OOB squad he thought might be just the ticket. 

“A bank,” Lowe said. “You just . . . stopped being assassin and started, what, working in a fucking bank?” 

“Pretty much,” Drefleck said. “Nice work if you can get it. Especially at our rates. And, when it comes to ways to earn money, it beats impersonating members of the fucking criminal underworld, I’ll tell you that for free. Although, to be honest, at least initially, we weren’t too keen. I massively over-quoted for the job, never expecting to hear anything else. But then matey boy-” Drefleck looked at the cooling body on the floor- “replied to say ‘how about we stick 50% on that and get the fuck on with it.’ There wasn’t much else to say after that. We took a few weeks getting up to speed before the insertion itself took place. My boys were all given files, we studied them, learned our roles, and then when they turned up on the first morning of the job . . . well, space had been made for them to slip into.” 

“And that doesn’t bother you?” Latham asked. “Do you ever ask what happens to the people you’re ‘replacing’?” 

Drefleck shrugged, that lazy, unsettling motion that wasn’t so much a shift of his shoulders as a slow redistribution of mass. “Eggs. Omelettes You know how that goes. Literally, actually. The Warden said the bodies were stored away in some fucking farmfood warehouse he’d acquired.” He pointed at Lowe and shared a coordinate. “They’re all in there if it means anything to you.”

Lowe filed the address away for another time. He thought about all he had read of the lives of those who had worked in the Vault. Of Whitlow, in that memory Nuroon had showed him, doing his job to the very best of his ability. None of those that had been so casually ‘removed’ had been important in the way that Soar measured things. But all of them had been living life the way Lowe thought it was supposed to be lived. 

He felt unaccountably sad. He hadn’t realised he’d actually been holding out hope that they’d all still turn up. Hearing Drefleck speak to casually about their final resting place was a gut punch he had not been expected. That they had been so easily discarded by their superiors . . . 

Lowe’s eyes moved to the dead body of Morholt on the floor. Karma, whilst a bitch, got it pretty spot on some times, didn’t she?

“We insist that all that sort of thing is taken care of before we arrive,” Drefleck continued, as if that somehow absolved him. “We weren’t in the business of killing any fucking civilians. Well below our paygrade for one thing. Our job was to take over from them and run the Vault as if nothing had changed. And to make sure that, when shit went down, we were the ones one the spot to handle it.” 

“So?” Rook prompted 

“So it would appear that we were clearly in over our fucking heads. One moment, it was the dullest, most well-paid job in the world. And I mean that sincerely. If we’d seen out the full term of the hire, we’d have been able to retire on an island somewhere. And the next I was getting panicked Sending Stone messages from a quickly dwindling number my people. About an attack. About people’s heads exploding. And then some of the eeriest fucking laughing I’d ever heard. 

“Me and all the others who weren’t on shift that night got down there as fast as we could—just in time to see you waltzing in like you’d booked a tour. Next thing I know, Cuckoo House is all over the case and the whole place is locked down tight. No one in, no one out. No new information coming or going. Even then, we were tempted to hang around and see what happened - I even had Syncler put undercover here to keep an eye on Morholt and make sure he wasn’t going to try and short us - but then a little birdie told me someone was pulling our files back at HQ and all sorts of questions presented themselves.”

Lowe felt something settle cold in his gut. Lant. He has asked the Deathcaller to find out who the bodies in the Vault were. It had been that probing which had alerted the Shimmerskins something was going down.

 “You thought Lowe was on your trail,” Rook said. 

 “Bingo.” 

“So you what?” Lowe asked, “Just decided to kill me and all my friends?” 

 “Oh, don’t be stupid,” Drefleck said, as if offended at the very idea. “We don’t do anything for free! No, we were still figuring out how to extricate what was left of the squad out of Soar,” he said. “We’d discussed cutting our losses, maybe reinventing ourselves somewhere else. Then, lo and behold, just when we were planning to leave, we get offered another fucking massive contract. And let me tell you,” Drefleck continued, “this one looked easy. Beautifully simple. How hard could it be, after all? Killing a Classless Inspector and his little gang of nobodies?” He grinned. “Turns out? Plenty fucking hard.” 

Lowe didn’t return the smile. He was too busy trying to put everything together. Something wasn’t clicking. The Vault. The slaughter. The hit contract. Something didn’t add up. “Hang on. Who gave you that contract? Was it Morholt?” 

Drefleck shook his head. 

“The Mayor?” Latham said

Another lazy shrug. “Nah. It was some wanker calling himself the Black Knight.” There was a beat during which Drefleck obviously enjoyed the impact of those words on Lowe. “Which brings me to what I assume is the more pressing issue for all you fine people. The whereabouts of all the rest of your friends.”

The tension in the room ramped up fairly considerably at that.

“So, full disclosure time,” Drefleck said. “I need out. You Soar types play far too rough for me and I’m happy to leave you to it. I came here today to see what I could get out of matey boy,” he nodded down at Morholt, “but someone else had obviously decided he needed to go permanently quiet. The way I figure it, whoever did that must now know about me. I sense we’re moving to the Finding Out stage of proceedings and I need to make myself scarce.”

“So what, you’re going to tell me where you’ve squirrelled away my friends in return for . . . what? Safe passage out of Soar?”

“Kind of. But you see, I think you might have grasped the wrong end of the stick here. Sure I know where the rest of the group is is, but it’s not us that took them off the board.”

This revelation, doubtless, would have been a very fruitful area for discussion—one that might have led to revelations, accusations, and no small amount of self-congratulatory gloating from Drefleck—had it not been rather abruptly forestalled. 

Specifically, by the explosion that came screaming through the bank window. 

And, even more specifically, by the subsequent and immediate disappearance of Drefleck’s head. 

            







	***





                A spray of wet, red mist filled the space above the Shimmerskin’s shoulders.  

For a half-second, the room was frozen in the tableau of what had just happened. Drefleck’s body remained upright, as if it hadn’t quite gotten the memo yet, hands still mid-gesture, before it finally decided that the absence of a head was a critical issue and slumped forward onto the ruined desk.  

Blood fanned out across the papers.  

Someone was shouting. Lowe thought it might well be him. He should be moving. He knew that. He knew that. Every muscle in his body screamed at him to do something. To dive for cover. To return fire. To react. But his mind had already left not just the room, it had left the present. And was back in a dingy cafe opposite a park.  

Again.  

Then he was watching as the park erupted into chaos with the horrifying suddenness of the end of his world.  Faulks had been mid-sentence, still trying to steer Highberg away from the bench, when her head exploded. Her blood and Drefleck’s merged in his mind. A bloody fog of horror.

A crack of an explosion. The sound echoing off the buildings.  

Then silence.  

Then screaming.  

“SNIPER!” someone had yelled.  

No.  

Not someone.  

It was Rook.  

But present-day Rook. The Threshold Guardian, version. Not his friend who had ceased being alive on that day. The urgent, screaming voice overlapped with the one in Lowe’s memory, and he felt the sting of the memory crash down on him. The unbearable wrongness of it all. The bodies falling in the park. The body collapsing here. The sudden, obliterating certainty that people around him were dying. Again! That he was too slow. Again! That if he turned his head again there would be another lifeless crater where someone he knew had been standing—  

Another explosion.

Another body hitting the ground.  

Arman.  

No. Latham.  

It was all blurring together.  

A golden lance of light speared down from above, vaporizing Highberg in a burst of heat and judgment.  

No, that wasn’t right.  

That was before. This was now. And Rook was moving. 

Lowe saw him through the haze, shifting toward the shattered window, some sort of blade already in hand, eyes scanning the rooftops. “There! Corner of Mesmerism and Fortune. On the rooftop,” he said, pointing with his knife. When did Rook start carrying a knife? “Lowe!”  

Then his body was moving before his mind had fully caught up and he was running before the next explosion occurred.

His boots hit Morholt’s desk, then his chair, and then the floor. Lowe crossed the room in a heartbeat and - for reasons which he would have struggled to explain - chose to fling himself through the broken window.  

Glass caught the light as it spun around him, shards of it glittering like spots of frozen time.  

The onrushing street below was a blur coming up to meet him, a rush of movement and voices and unaware civilians going about their day as if the last five seconds hadn’t rewritten their everything. Lowe supposed it hadn’t. Not for them. But, then again, they weren’t in pursuit of their Nemesis.  

Lowe crash landed on the pavement. Hard. In a way that suggested he had, at some point in the descent, made several critical miscalculations regarding physics, momentum, and his own invulnerability. Unfortunately, with his now very high Perception he got to appreciate every single one of those miscalculations in excruciating, frame-by-frame detail.  

He’s noticed, for instance, the way his ankle twisted just as he hit the window frame. He’d noticed the slight, wet pop as it dislocated itself, followed by the way the rest of his leg immediately gave up and flopped beneath him like a fish. He’d also noticed the sensation of his ribs folding inwards as his torso made an enthusiastic and rather final-sounding introduction to the cobblestone, which were—surprise, surprise!—much less forgiving than they had initially appeared. Then he noticed, mid-bounce, that his shoulder had definitely exited its assigned seating arrangement.  

And he certainly noticed, upon landing, that the reason he was struggling to inhale might have something to do with the fact that his lungs were currently experiencing an unsanctioned field trip outside of their usual containment zone.  

He lay there for a long, rather too thoughtful moment, his body an abstract study in wrong angles. One of those thoughts was how the tableau could have been entitled ‘this is why people don’t jump out of fifth floor windows.’  

Then Roll With The Punches kicked in.  

Oh, goody.  

And because the universe wasn’t content with simply breaking him into little pieces, it decided he needed to be fully cognisant of the healing process, too. Arkola’s help with raising his Perception wasn’t seeming such a boon right about now.

Bone snapped back into place, muscles stitched themselves together, and—somewhere within him—his organs politely but firmly rearranged themselves back to their original locations. Lowe groaned once, twice and then staggered upright

“Well,” he said, rolling his reassembled shoulder and waving to the horrified bystanders who’d witnessed his fall. “That was somewhat unnecessary.”  

Then he ran.

Above him, he could hear Latham roaring something out of the broken window after him, but he didn’t stop to listen and the exact words were lost in the wind.

He couldn’t stop. Arbella had been taken and, if it was the last thing he did, it would be to make sure he didn’t have to find her body in an abandoned warehouse with all that fucking laughing going on. Because if it wasn’t the Shimmerskins that had taken his friends, that really did leave only one logical option.Unauthorized use of content: if you find this story on Amazon, report the violation.

There was no time for hesitation. Bodies were not going to pile up while he stood there trying to piece it all together. Not again. This time, he was going to be fast enough. He wasn’t going to be there in time.  

The building Rook had been pointing at wasn’t actually too far, but plenty far enough to be a problem to get at quickly. Saying that, though, Lowe’s path looked clear enough, in the same way that Soar’s streets were ever clear—which was to say, they were enthusiastically occupied by drunks, street vendors, lost tourists, and all sorts of opportunists who saw a man fall to what should have been his death and immediately wondered whether his pockets were worth picking.  

Lowe hit the first stack of crates piled up against a wall, his boots landing with a thunk that sent a disgruntled Fishmonger cursing into the night. He ignored him, focused on the next step on his way up and into the sky—a market awning, stretched wide over some very questionable fruit.  

He leapt and his foot hit fabric, dipped alarmingly, and then responded enthusiastically to his weight, flinging him upwards. Lowe scrabbled as he flew untethered and then began yet another rapid descent. Fortunately, his fingertips grazed the edge of the first rooftop - the one he had been aiming at. It was slate and wet, which was profoundly unhelpful to his current situation. He grabbed it anyway, muscles straining as he managed to haul himself up onto the flat roof.  

A flower pot exploded next to his head and he rolled. It appeared his target wasn’t all that content to have him close the distance unmolested. 

"Oi!" someone bellowed from an unseen window above him. "Some of us are tryin’ to sleep!"  

Lowe chose not dignify this with a response, mostly because he was already back to his feet and running, dashing across the uneven rooftop with the single-minded urgency of a man who had just remembered that snipers, famously, did not love close quarter melee fighting.

The next jump was a bastard.  

The building across from him was just far enough to make Lowe’s attempt to cross it seem mildly suicidal, but also just close enough that not trying was the sort of thing cowards and people who liked having intact femurs did.  

It turned out that, on this night and in this mood, Lowe wasn’t either of those.  

He took three quick strides, pushed off—  

And landed, rolling into a hard shoulder slam against a chimney stack that belched out an irritable puff of soot.  Lowe, in sympathy, coughed right back, staggered - Roll with the Punches refusing bone - and then kept moving to the spot Rook had pinpointed.  

As he ran, the city sprawled below him, all twisting alleys and shivering manalight. It was a network of gutters and broken cobbles that had never been kind to him. And, dominating the skyline was the Celestial Temple. He hoped Arkola was enjoying the latest episode in the shitshow that was Lowe’s life. Probably with a box of divine popcorn.

Somewhere behind him, someone was shouting, but that didn’t matter. The next ledge was waiting. And up. And that was the only thing that mattered right now. Lowe hit the final ledge and hauled himself over, breath coming heavily as he landed in a crouch. Mylaf’s jokes about his expanding waistline didn’t seem quite so cruel right about now. He used to do this sort of pursuit for fun. Taking a moment to orientate himself, he looked out on almost the whole of Soar stretched out before him—twisted chimneys, slumping rooftops, the endless sprawl of old brick and opportunistic expansion, a city stitched together.  

His gaze swept the rooftop.  

There.  

A shadow moved at the far edge of the roof he was on, just past the flickering glow of a mana lantern. A man. Long coat. A crossbow—no, not quite. The shape was wrong, the angles too clean, but Lowe didn’t wait to analyse it any further. His hands filled with Slugger, mana coursing down his arms as his fingers clenched, ready to charge—  

And then he became aware of the attacks. They were a weight in his skull. A pressure that almost made his thoughts tilt and reality bend. His body locked up for a fraction of a second, a sickening, ice-hot pull in his head . . . But then Mental Fortress asserted itself and his manacle pulsed, with blast after blast of mana draining away as his Skill slammed into place, blocking the unseen mental assault before it could take hold.  

Lowe groaned as all his available mana vanished in an instant. No. Not quite all of it, not yet, but far too much. And far too quickly. It might say Level 26 above his head, but he had the mana pool of twice that and it took more than a few psychic buffers to drain that ocean dry. However, with each assault his Skills deflected away, the shadow in front of him blurred, vanished and then reappeared. Then vanished again.  

Further mental attacks slammed into him, but Mental Fortress took the hit, chewing up another chunk of his mana as his mind was dragged into a pull and push of Pressure and attempted foreign influence. However, each attack ultimately  failed and the shadowy man he was running towards glitched out and vanished again. Was it an illusion?

Lowe shook his head and tried to concentrate. He was still himself. Still here. But, if he wasn’t careful - and these attacks kept rolling in - he was in danger of running out of mana. Which considering all the damage Roll with the Punches was still trying to sort out, wasn’t likely an ideal state of being.

Then his manacle flickered and Pressure surged through his body, heat rolling down his limbs, burning through his exhaustion. Lowe thought about using it for retaliation, but if he did that and the attack didn’t stick, he was screwed. He opted instead for a full mana refresh, feeding off the surge which allowed his mind to snap back into focus and really push away whatever was trying to befuddle him. 

This caused the shadow of the man with the strange crossbow to disappear for the last time.  

At first, Lowe thought finally defeating the mental Skill had left him alone on the rooftop. But no. He wasn’t quite on his own. Because in the man’s place, there was a box. Lowe’s step hitched as he closed in on it. And not because of what it was. But because of how many times he’d seen it before.  

It was a small wooden box, cheap and mass-produced, the kind sold in every single joke shop in Soar. Lowe knew this, because he had asked. Researched. Thoroughly explored each and every sale of this particular box throughout the city. It was roughly the size of a man’s palm, with a crude etching of lips stretched  into a grin burned into the lid.  

A Laughing Box, it was called.  

A box that, when opened, would do nothing more than let out a high-pitched, distorted cackle. In reality, it was just a cheap gimmick. A joke. Something street magicians used to amuse children before lifting their purses. Funnily enough, in the context in which he came across them, Lowe had never really seen the funny side.

He stooped and picked the box up, his fingers hovering over the lid. Not yet ready to see what was inside. For a moment, he just looked at it. So small. So utterly, insultingly ordinary. He already suspected what was going to happen when he flicked it open. The laugh would start immediately. Thin, mechanical, and warped from overuse. He’d heard that sound far too often. 

But, on this occasion, it wasn’t the laughter that made beads of sweat pop out on his head. No, on this night, and on this rooftop, the thing that caused him dread was because of what the box contained. A piece of card with an image impressed on it.

The picture was small and square and, slightly curled at the edges where it had been tucked beneath the mechanism of the box. It was a group picture. Arebella. Hel. Karolen. Ortel.  

All of them. They were tied up, faces pale, drawn and utterly furious. 

Lowe’s grip on the box tightened as his Perception flared and he locked onto the details, ensuring Grid View was firing as he did so. His friends didn’t appear to be hurt in the picture. They weren’t bloody. But they were clearly very stressed. His friends were being held.  

But that wasn’t the worse thing, was it? 

No. That was the single folded note that lay at the very bottom of the box. Lowe pulled it out,, unfolded it, and read the single word in familiar handwriting.  

Checkmate.  

Lowe stared at it for a moment, before closing the box.  

The laughter stopped.  

            







	***





                Lowe was aware that the rest of the day passed, though not in any meaningful way he was truly able to mark. It was just a bunch of somethings that happened, with the bells sliding past in a shapeless smear of movement, voices and obligations that he, temporarily, did not have the energy to care about.  

He wasn't entirely sure who had come to collect him from the rooftop. Probably Latham. Yes. It had to have been Latham, didn’t it? No one else would have been able to so easily pick him and carry him down to ground level. And even if they could, they’d have needed the sheer bloody-minded force of will to bother.  

At some point, he thought he had given a statement. To Staffen, he believed. That much he thought he could remember. Or at least, he remembered saying words and hearing questions, but the actual content of either was lost somewhere in the fog of his fear.  He assumed his boss had said something comforting. Probably something about getting a fucking grip you utter wetwipe.

Lowe remembered that Cenorth had said something similar to him in the days following the collapse of the Highberg case - another time when everything had ended and he had spent too much time staring at the inside of a bottle, trying to find a version of himself that he didn’t hate.  That was the last time he had experienced such a strange unreality of time. The sense that existence was something happening to him rather than something he was involved with.  

Except, and he couldn’t believe he was even thinking this, he thought back then had been preferable to now.  

Back then, he’d still had choices. Not many, for sure. Whether he’d choose Classtration or Execution wasn’t much of a menu to select from, but at least that veneer of possibility still existed. 

Now? Now he had nowhere left to fall. And the Black Knight had taken his friends from him again.  

Lowe didn’t think the full horror of that had fully hit yet. He sensed he was too numb to properly appreciate it and that the pain was lingering at the edges of his awareness, waiting for his brain to slow down enough to really feel it.  But he knew the moment was coming.  

And when it did, he suspected that it would break him.  

So he didn’t dare let his brain stop whirling.  He couldn’t stop, because if he did that would be it . . .  

Somewhere between leaving the rooftop and ending up—wherever the hell he was now—he thought his memories must have become unreliable. He felt like he was experiencing a mix of a hangover, severe head injuries, and particularly ambitious drug cocktails. Whatever mental Skill had battered against him had packed quite a punch. Just because he’d been able to tank it, didn’t mean there were no after effects. And, on top of everything else, they were kicking his arse.

His body was moving on autopilot, responding to the external stimuli of the chaos of an urgent Cuckoo House investigation without the inconvenient process of thinking getting in the way. Because people he cared about were missing, but that seemed to be being trumped by the Warden of the Reserve being murdered and evidence of an OOB squad operating in Soar. 

He guessed, in a moment where rationality and consideration met, it was unsurprising that the disappearance of an assassin, a lawyer, a bean counter and a truth-teller ranked pretty low in the scheme of things. 

Not when it seemed like the Black Knight was riding again.

At some point in the day, it seemed he’d taken a shower. He remembered the warm water had washed over him, dragging some of the dried blood and soot away but failing to remove any of the actual dirt he felt under his skin.  At some point, he appeared to have changed his clothes.  At another, he’d ended up in a chair. And at some point—definitely later, possibly earlier—he’d come to this bar.  

The drink in front of him was full, although the six glasses next to it were not. He had no memory of ordering it.  Or them. He wasn’t sure if that meant he had drunk the empty ones, but if he had, they had scoured his taste buds clear and completely lost track of tasting them. But, he supposed, it didn’t really matter. The point was, he was still sitting. He was still waiting. For what, exactly?

He had no idea.  

The laughter from the box was still ringing in his ears. Thin, warped and ever-so amused. And somewhere beneath it, the image of his friends, looking up at whoever had captured the image of their faces. Man, had they all looked pissed . . .

He had asked each of them for their help. And as repayment for their kindness, he had let them be taken. 

That thought slipped through his mind, causing Lowe to dive once again into his drink. Then somewhere, in the periphery of his vision, the world tilted again. His hand twitched toward his manacle on reflex, but there was no mental attack taking place.  

No, there was no Skill being used on him this time. Just his memory choosing to torture him some more.  

The fractured - too-bright - wrong kind of memory that didn’t feel like remembering so much as reliving. It was Grid View mixed in with remembrance, so it came in uncertain flickers. There he was, inside Soar Museum. And he was dead. The heat. The pressure of the Dreadnaught crushing him. Then, the moment when the Dungeon had collapsed in on itself, when the past had forced itself upon him—when it had dragged him back into the moment of his Classtration. Into the screaming. The pain. The sensation of being ripped apart and left hollow—  

And now. Now, this.  

A different kind of hollow.  A different kind of being ripped apart. 

Something in the back of his mind laughed—the box, the Black Knight, Soar, Arkola, himself—and the memory shifted.  

He was back in the park as it erupted into chaos with the horrifying suddenness of the end of the world. Faulks. Her head— A crack, echoing off the buildings, off the cobblestones, off the inside of his skull—  The moment of frozen horror, the stunned silence before the screams— “Sniper!”  

No.  

Not again.  

This isn’t happening again.

Arman.  

His chest, caving inward like someone had taken a hammer to a porcelain doll.  

Coda.  

Golden light shattering through his shield, his body twitching, the smell of burning flesh.  

“Faulks, Coda, Arman…”  

The words were falling out of his mouth again, like a prayer. Like a curse. Like a fucking tally sheet.  

“Rook? Can you see anything?”

Silence.  

The bags of gold rolled harmlessly to the side. Mocking. Mundane. The people behind them, however, were gone.  Just like now. Just like . . .

No.

Not like now. 

Lowe snapped back to himself. His knuckles were white against the glass. His jaw hurt. Had he been gritting his teeth?  He didn’t remember. He supposed it didn’t matter. He forced his fingers to unclench from the glass, and dragged himself back into the present. If there had ever been a time to wallow in it, it wasn’t now. Because, right now, his friends had been taken. And he could either be all sad, or he could get them back.  

Lowe finished his drink, pulsed Roll with the Punches through him to clear the alcohol and stood up.

He was done playing the Black Knight’s game. It was time to put some pieces of his own in play.

***

“How good is Hel?”

“Little man, what the fuck of you doing here? We both need to sleep if we’re going to be any use to the search tomorrow.”

“I don’t want to be any use tomorrow. I want to be useful now. Which is why I need you to confirm something for me. How good is Hel?”

“Lowe, you smell like a fucking brewery. What have you been drinking?”

“The sweet scent of inspiration, my friend. A little smell I’m thinking of bottling and selling to the masses. I’m thinking I’m going to call it ‘victory.’ But only, and this is crucial, only if you wake up and clarify for me how good Hel is.”

Latham swung his legs over the side of his bed and sat up, staring at Lowe. “Look, I get you have had a shock, we both have. But you have to believe there’s no way they don’t get found tomorrow. The Mayor’s authorised all sorts of exciting overtime to find the fucking Black Knight. In a few bells, we’re not going to be able to move for motivated and well-recompensed powerhouses kicking arse and taking names to solve the murder of the Warden of the Reserve. Very, very quickly, the Black Knight’s going to have nowhere to hide and that is when we’ll find our friends. You breaking into my house and waking me up is not going to help with that.”The story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.

“What if I told you I could find a way to get our hands on him before anyone else. Wouldn’t you like that?”

Latham’s hands bunched, then he said softly. “Yeah. I’d like that.”

“Well then, how about you answer my question. How good is Hel?”

Latham stood and it appeared that he was sleeping in his Temple Warder armour. That was quite a trip, Lowe thought. “She’s the best I’ve ever known.”

“Yeah, that’s kind of what I thought. Okay, so I have a plan.”

“Is it a good plan?”

“It’s not a terrible plan.”

“How likely is it to get us killed?”

“You? No chance. Me? An absolute certainty. But I’ll rally.”

“Sold. A plan with no downsides. So what do we do?”

“First up, we need to make sure that neither of us are Shimmerskins,” Lowe said. “There’s far too much of that sort of bollocks going around and if we’re going to do this properly, then we need some sort of safeword.”

“Little man, I never, ever want to hear you tell me the two of us need a safeword.”

“Fair point. Tell you what, you tell me what Hel’s codeword to Tenia was, and I’ll believe that you are you.”

“You’re serious?”

“I’m serious.”

A Rune of Silence appeared in Latham’s hand, and he crushed it, putting an impenetrable bubble around them. “Moist weasel. You happy?”

“Very happy. Okay, so the plan is this . . .”

“No, no, no. You now know I’m not a Shimmerskin, but how do I know the same about you?”

“Ask me something only I would know.”

“Actually, I think I need something a bit more . . . you know, hands on. Something you can do, but a Shimmerskin wouldn’t be able to.”

“Like what?”

Latham moved too quickly for Lowe to be able to track, striking him under the chin and sending him flying through the air. Blood of the Phoenix had kicked it before the Inspector even hit the floor. “What the fuck, Latham! You just killed me!”

“And you broke into my house in the middle of the night. We’re quits. Now, tell me your plan?”

***

Lowe held the picture the Black Knight had sent in his mind, studying it through Grid View, letting his Perception go to work. Latham, standing beside him, held the actual photograph, pouring over it, trying to identify what it was Lowe wanted him to notice.

 

“It’s no good, little man. I just don’t see it,” Latham said. “It’s a picture of all of them tied up. Which, I agree, is not ideal. However, there’s no way the Black Knight’s going to let you have anything with any sort of clue in it. This is supposed to be mocking you. Nothing more. ”  

 

“I get that’s the intention,” Lowe said. “He used to send us loads of these when he was first active. They drove us all mad because they felt like they should mean something, but never did.” For a moment, he was back in the past, Arman furious. Faulks swearing a blue streak. Rook silently pinning the images on the board whilst Coda studied them, He shook his head, looking the memory away. He needed to stay grounded in the present. “But we already know something about this picture which he doesn’t.”

 

“Which is?”

 

“Which is Hel being a fucking legend. Bear with me a moment,” Lowe said, zooming into the image using Grid View as quickly as he could: Latham did not look like a man prepared to bear with anything. He looked like a man prepared to grab Lowe’s head between his hands and crush it into atoms. But, even though his healing cooldown was still not reset, Lowe did his best to ignore him.  

 

His friends were all there in this image. Each of them was furious, clearly exhausted and very tied up. None of them had any obvious injuries, which was both a good thing but was also a touch confusing. Neither Latham nor Lowe could think of many circumstances where Karolen or, especially, Hel were going to be trussed up without fighting back. 

 

However, the lack of obvious wounds suggested the Black Knight wanted them alive. That, or he was saving the entertainment for later, but Lowe was trying very hard not to go down that particular mental alley. Some of the bodies he’d seen during the man’s first rampage had been . . . not well treated.

 

Lowe let his gaze drift over the details in the image, cataloguing everything in a desperate attempt to focus on anything except how completely he had, once again, failed to keep his friends safe.  

 

Karolen’s jaw was clenched with a barely suppressed fury that suggested whoever had tied her up should be very grateful she didn’t have access to sharp objects. Ortel’s lips were pressed into a thin, white line, the edges of his mouth betraying a curse frozen mid-sentence. Arebella’s glare was fixed on their unseen kidnapper, a look that, under normal circumstances, would put a man in an early grave. She’d only looked at him like that a few times and it had been more than enough.  

 

But then there was Hel.  

 

Lowe’s focus narrowed. And narrowed. And narrowed. 

 

She was tied up just like the others, but she wasn’t angry. Okay, she was pissed, but she wasn’t ‘just’ angry. She was focused. On something that was just over the shoulder of whoever was capturing the image. At first glance, it might have seemed like she was just looking in the same direction as the others. But no. Her gaze was almost distant. As if she was making use of a Skill.

 

“I knew it. There it is,” Lowe said.

 

“What?” Latham said, flipping the photograph over, as if the back of it would reveal some hidden context.  

 

Lowe didn’t answer. He was zooming further in, honing in on something else that had just caught his eye— Hel’s fingers. They were captured in the process of twitching. Small, tiny movements. And Lowe didn’t think it was just her struggling against her bonds. And it wasn’t her fidgeting. He thought Hel was shaping air.  

 

Now, most people thought of Wind Tyrants as these flashy powerhouses. Big, sweeping gales. Storms. Tearing things apart with violent hurricanes. Literal forces of nature. But the best of them? The truly terrifying ones? Sure, they could do all that but, what was so much more, they could do some of their best work with subtlety. A hand resting on a table could steal the air from your lungs just as effectively as a hurricane could crush your skull. A whisper on the breeze could slice through armour as easily as a lightning bolt. A locked room with all of its air removed was as much as a death sentence as a tidal wave.  

 

And Hel? Well, Latham had confirmed it, hadn’t he? She was the best.  

 

Lowe’s eyes were on her hair. All things considered, it should have been lying flat. Tangled. Limp from all the stress and the captivity. But a single lock—just one—seemed to be settled wrong. And he didn’t think it was caught by a stray puff of wind, not disturbed by an unseen breeze. It was twisted. Looped.  

 

It spelled something.  

 

Tiny letters, formed by air, held for the briefest moment against the strands of her hair—just as the image was taken—before they dissipated away. It would have taken split second timing, and it needed to be ever-so subtle for the Black Knight not to notice it.

 

Lowe focused Grid View in even tighter, stretching the bounds of his Perception and the letters solidified.  

 

GNROLLG

 

“Got you,” he said.  

 

“Got who? What? You’re going to have to let me in on whatever grand revelation is happening in your brain, because I’ve got nothing.” Latham was staring at the physical picture. “What are you even looking at? Because all I see is Hel tied up and glaring like she’s trying to unmake whoever took the photo.”  

 

“She’s doing something with her hair,” Lowe said, still locked onto the strands in Grid View. “Or rather, she’s using the air around her hair. Just enough to shape the wind for a fraction of a second.”  

 

Latham frowned at the image again, flipped it over, held it up to the light, then—just for thoroughness—gave it a little shake. “Fuck it. I can’t see anything.”  

 

“That’s because you’re working with peasant-tier vision,” Lowe said.  

 

“How long is it before I’m allowed to kill you again?”  

 

“Too long,”  

 

“Fine, then you better explain.”  

 

“She’s spelling something,” Lowe said. “Seven letters. GNROLLG.”  

 

Latham’s expression went through several phases of incomprehension before finally landing on, “That’s not a word.”  

 

“No. It’s an acronym.”  

 

“For what?”  

 

“I think she’s telling us where he’s holding them.”  

 

“You mean to tell me,” he said slowly, “that instead of just writing it normally, she decided to give us an anagram hair puzzle?”  

 

“It’s not an anagram puzzle. It’s an acronym.”  

 

“Oh, forgive me, I must have missed the national fucking standard for emergency hostage messaging!”  

 

“Look, I get it. You’re upset. You wanted a straightforward message. ‘Help. We are here. Come quickly. They are not feeding Ortel and he is getting cranky.’”  

 

“Well, that would have been nice and straightforward, little man.”  

 

“Well, welcome to Hel’s way of doing things. She didn’t know how long they’d have before they were searched. She didn’t know if this picture would be sent immediately or later. And she needed to tell us where they were in a way the Black Knight wouldn’t spot.”  

 

“But you know where they are?”

 

“I think so.”  

 

“Could you be wrong?”  

 

 “Have you ever known me to be wrong?”  

 

“Are you fucking kidding me?”

 

“Okay. Not a high bar, that’s on me. But, yes, I think I know where they are.”

                Pernille Staffen was worried. And considering the general thrust of her career over the years, it took rather a lot for that to happen.  

She hadn't wanted the Commander role. She'd been extremely, delightfully, comfortably retired. Little house in Jewel Town. More grandchildren than she could easily name. Finally, the opportunity to catch up on her knitting. But then Cenorth had shit the bed, and the Mayor had, personally, asked her to come in and change the sheets.  

"How hard could it be?" her husband had said. "It's hardly like Cuckoo House is going to be like being back on the Wall, is it?" he’d said. "Might be nice to have something to get you out from under my feet for a couple of hours a day. And, to be honest, there's only so many fucking beanie hats one man can wear." 

How hard could it be?  

Well, it turned out pretty hard indeed.  

First, there had been all the fallout from Cenorth’s death to clear up. She had needed to ensure the Security Services weren’t left looking like absolute Soar-beating chumps. It had stuck in her craw to push the narrative that wanker was some sort of hero who’d gone down in the brave defense of peace, love and the Soarian way, but that was the deal she’d brokered to get Jana Lowe off everyone’s shit list.

And she was pleased she’d done so. Staffen had always liked the man - had kept half an eye on his career over the years -  although she suspected he might not realise it. He might be an arsehole, but he was an honest arsehole, and in a world of gaping, sweaty crap buckets, that made him the rarest of things to Pernille Staffen.  

Then, hot on the heels of that there’d been the Soar Museum debacle, which she was sure had added a whole host of new grey hairs to her reflection every morning. Nevertheless, Lowe had come through there again. And he’d royally pissed off Grackle Nuroon to the bargain. Big tick there.  

But then there was the nightmare of these last few days…  

Staffen lit her pipe as she flicked through the best info Cuckoo House had on the Black Knight. The pickings were slim.  

This twat was an old ghost story. One people whispered about in the dark rooms of power, half-believing, half-praying they never met the reality of it. He’d been a killer who had made a particular habit of targeting the great and the good of Soar—though ‘great’ was a subjective term, and ‘good’ was outright inaccurate. The victims had all been power players in one form or another. Bankers, council members, crime lords, the occasional overly ambitious military officer. Not the sort who left mourners, just empty suits whose deaths caused inconvenient shifts in power. Ones which a suspiciously well-connected number of people had made the most of . . . 

The Black Knight had been a problem for a while, a silent blade in the city’s underbelly, and more than a few people had suspected that the Mayor had been the one holding the purse strings. It would have made sense, she supposed. The Mayor had always been good at arrangements, and sometimes arrangements required knives rather than words. But no one had ever been able to pin it on him. And, from flicking through the Black Knight’s file, it looked like everyone and his Aunt Bessy had tried.

Then the whole thing had come to a head in that disastrous operation Lowe had overseen, and his had been the head which had been the one to roll down the hill. Fucking Cenorth. If there was one thing Staffen hated, it was a boss who didn’t stand up for their people. Cenorth had as good as Classtrated Lowe himself. The Council rubberstamping his recommendation had been pretty much  assured once he’d finished with his ‘evidence’.  

And, for whatever reason, that had been the end of the Black Knight.  

Well, at least it had been, until that night in the Vault.  

Staffen puffed away on her pipe in silence, before closing the file in disgust. There was nothing of interest in here. Nothing new, anyway.  

A knock on her door.  

"What?”

"Sorry to interrupt, boss," Osbourne said. And to be fair to him, looking at his face, he really was very, very sorry. Or was at least scared to interrupt her musing.

"Well, you have, so get the fuck on with it before I pull your nose off and use it for an ashtray"  

"It’s Inspector Lowe…"  

Staffen sighed. "Of course it fucking is. What’s that wanker done this time?"

"We’re not sure. It’s just…"  

"Any more ellipses, and I’m going to use this pipe to complete a fucking radical colonoscopy. What is it?"  

"You know how you asked for a tracking cantrip to be installed on his Sending Stone?"

"As I’m not yet suffering from senile delusions, yes. Yes, I do."

"Well it appears he’s, somehow, turned it off. Well, at least someone has turned the tracking off.”

Staffen sat still for a moment, swearing under her breath, before grabbing her coat and moving to the door.  "Fuck it. That means either he’s going to do something stupid or someone is going to try something stupid on him. Neither fills me full of glee."

She moved fast through Cuckoo House, cane tapping against the floor, the scent of her pipe smoke trailing behind her. Osbourne struggled to keep up, but he was a younger man, and she wasn’t about to slow down for the sake of his knees.  

"Where was the last ping?" she asked.  

"Somewhere near the Central Market," he replied, "About half a bell ago."  

"Half a bell? How long did it take you to find your balls and come and tell me. No, don’t answer that. So, do we have any idea where he might have gone now?"  

"Sorry boss. Either he’s gone somewhere that scrambles the signal, or he’s switched it off deliberately." 

"What do we have near the Market?"

"We’ve got two agents covering the North side, but they’re on foot. We could deploy a unit from the nearest Portal Stone—"

"No."

Osbourne frowned. "No?"  

"Lowe’s a prick, but he’s a competent prick. If he worked out we’re tracking him and turned off his Sending Stone, it means he either doesn’t want us watching, or he’s already in the middle of something that doesn’t need a battalion of jackboots stomping through it." 

“But what if someone has turned it off for him . . .”

Staffen paused, and then shook her head. “No. Let’s give Lowe some time to sort things out himself. That’s what I’d want you fuckers to do in this situation if it was me.”

"So what do we do, Commander?"

"We watch. We wait. And when he inevitably gets himself into deep enough shit that he does need us, we make sure we’re ready to pull him out."

"Understood."  

Staffen took one last draw of her pipe before knocking the contents out onto a nearby table.  

"Oh, and get me the restricted file on the Black Knight. The one everyone thinks we don’t know about. The one from the Mayor’s private stash.

Osbourne hesitated. He liked it when he got to get his hands really dirty, but - well - there was dirty and then there was dirty. "You think the Mayor might have a hand in this?"

"I think the Mayor always has a hand in everything," Staffen said. "The question is whether he’s playing both sides, or just making sure he wins either way." She buttoned up her coat and turned toward the exit. "And find out where Lowe was last seen. I want discreet eyes on him before this turns into another mess."  

Osbourne nodded and jogged off, leaving Staffen standing at the edge of the corridor, the city stretching out beyond the high windows of Cuckoo House.  

“Good hunting, Lowe,” she whispered, and then went out into the night.

***

The Mayor stared out of his window, enjoying the slow movement of Soar beneath him. Royal Road is the home of this novel. Visit there to read the original and support the author.

This was a nice office, he thought. Spacious. Elegant. An office people nodded approvingly at when they walked in. It was a space that whispered of control. Which, after all, was exactly as things should be. The thick rugs, the mahogany desk, the bookshelves filled with weighty tomes he’d  never actually read but which suggested their owner was a man of depth and consequence. He enjoyed the projected illusion of being the repository for centuries of hard-earned wisdom. He was aware that people expected it from a man in his position, and he was more than happy to oblige. 

There was nothing so useful as being thought wise by fools.

He had worked hard to get here. Done many, many things that may not sit at all comfortably on his conscience, but the trick of it all was making peace with necessary sins. They had not come all at once—that would have been a fool’s game and no matter what his detractors thought of him, they all agreed he was no fool. Nevertheless, slowly, over time, each negotiated compromise had been a single stone in a road paved straight to his current seat in City Hall. 

And now he had this view of the whole of Soar beneath him.

A city of opportunity. A city of ambition. A city of cutthroats who liked to pretend they weren’t cutthroats. He had a particular fondness for those who fitted in to that last description. 

And a city, more than anything, of gods . . .

A frown crossed his face as he thought of that. Yes. The fucking gods. The gods in Soar were the reason it was the greatest of cities. Not its wealth, not its trade, not the glittering towers or the sprawling underbelly. It was the gods which made the city great. And gods, as anyone with half a brain in the city knew, were a problem.  

The role of the Mayor in Soar was entirely straightforward—keep the gods happy. In practice, that meant ensuring they could do whatever they pleased with as few consequences as possible. It meant cleaning up after them, smoothing over the inevitable wreckage of their divine tantrums, and ensuring the mortal population didn’t start asking questions they had no right to ask. It meant keeping the bodies hidden. And there were always bodies.  

The fucking gods.

And one god in particular. Arkola’s threat to destroy Soar was causing him no end of concern. Not quite as much as the death of Arven Morholt, to be sure, but it bothered him nonetheless. Those who provided him with information from within the Celestial Temple had been clear: the god did indeed intend to destroy Soar by the end of this newly breaking day if his property was not returned to him. 

Which was, by any measure, utterly terrifying. And yet… 

The Mayor watched Soar’s mana lights flicker out as the sun of a new day arose. By his reckoning, and he had thought long and hard about it, Arkola was bluffing. He could have destroyed the city six years ago if he had been so attached to that statute. That he had not was significant. Gods were many things, but they were not known for patience. That suggested Arkola wanted something more than simply vengeance. And it also suggested he was aware he was being reported on. Which was interesting. 

That meant negotiation was possible. That meant there were Priests who could be sold out for a favour. And a favour from a god . . . well, that was always worth having. And there would always be others within the Temple that were willing to sell their loyalty, if the price was high enough.

All things being equal, he thought he might actually end up ahead of the game on this one. Especially if that blasted Inspector could actually recover the missing item.

Of course, the surprising, and entirely unwelcome, reappearance of the Black Knight had somewhat thrown a rather large spanner into his wider gears. As, likewise, had the inopportune murder of Morholt. In the Mayor’s experience, Wardens of the Reserve who were so openly corruptible were rather thin on the ground. He suspected that the reemergence of the former probably had something to do with the latter. Which was irksome. Especially as he had thought that had all been dealt with. Once the usefulness from that quarter had ceased, he had seen to it personally. Permanently, he had thought. And well over a year ago.

Yet here that figure was, back from whatever grave had failed to hold him, and causing an absurd amount of disruption. There were few things that truly made the Mayor nervous, but a vendetta left unfinished had the potential to make even his considerable confidence waver.

But he would deal with it. The same way he always did.

Something glinted on the rooftop opposite.

The Mayor did not move, not at first. There was a certain animal instinct, deeply buried, that told men when they were being watched. He listened to it now, keeping his breathing even.

The glint did not come again.

Still, his hand drifted to the Sending Stone on his desk, and he pushed some mana into it.

Seconds later, the door opened.

Cairn entered, silent as ever, his bulk moving with surprising ease for a man of his Class. The Mayor did not look at him. He did not wish to take his eyes off the window.

“Rooftop opposite,” he said quietly.

Cairn nodded once and slipped back out.

The Mayor watched the awakening city as he waited for the allclear. He thought about Arkola. About the Black Knight. About the Inspector currently dragging his way through the filth of Soar to retrieve something stolen from a god. He thought about the people who had tried to outmaneuver him over the years. About the men and women who had whispered in the dark, certain they possessed the upper hand. 

None of them had lasted.

Not like he did.

A minute passed. Then another. Cairn still hadn’t returned.

Yes, it would all be fine, would it not? Arkola was bluffing, the Black Knight would vanish into history again and Lowe would recover the statue. And all would be well in Soar.

Another flash. Perhaps a trick of the early morning light? Or perhaps something else. 

And he thought that right until the explosion ripped through his window.

***

Hel had a long and complicated history with Suppression Totems.  

When you were one-on-oning a Level 70 Ragehorror, having a spare one of those bad boys in your pocket to slap down could be the difference between bleeding out in the mud and skipping home to fuck the prom queen. It was the only Skill, way back when, she had ever insisted Irek had to raise to Epic before she would let him join her squad, and it had saved their collective arses more times than anything else the Empath Nullifier had in his repertoire. 

But being on the receiving end of its power, though? That sucked the big one.  

Hel pulled on the ropes binding her arms and swore a blue streak up, down, left and right. The Black Knight had calibrated the Totem in this room to pull them all down to Level 8—which was proving to be the bugger to end all buggers. A slap in the face. A boot to the ribs. A shitty joke with her name as the punchline. Just a few days ago, she had been basking in the sheer delight of her newfound Level 50 Skills. Finally, she’d made the jump into the big leagues. The culmination of years of sweat and blood. And now she was back to where she’d been in kindergarten.  Level fucking 8. Functionally, pathetically and frustratingly helpless.  

Of course, being kidnapped, tied up, and locked in a fucking tomb was pretty debasing too.  

She screamed and pushed all her available mana against the Totem’s enforced restrictions, shoving at the very edges of her ability like a caged animal. Nothing happened and there was a beat of silence.  

“Did it work?” Karolen asked from her side in the room.  

“Did what work?”

“The eight millionth time you tried to break free. I was sure this time would be the ticket.”  

“Fuck off, Auditor.”  

“Would love to. If only there was a Level 50 uber-assassin around to help me escape. Oh, hang on, there is. But all she seems to be doing is screaming like a little bitch.”  

“Kay, cool it,” Arebella said. “This isn’t Hel’s fault.”  

“Well, technically…” Ortel began.  

“You can fuck off too!” Hel growled.  

Silence stretched. A pause for regret. None came.  

“We all heard him go out, right?” Arebella said eventually.  

“Yeah,” Hel said. “Him and that fucking weapon of his.” 

That gave them all pause for thought. That crossbow was, after all, the reason they were all here, was it not? Because when he pointed that thing at them, compliance was the only sane option.

The Black Knight was packing a Mythic-enhanced custom crossbow clearly made for piercing . . . well, anything. Shields. Armor. Flesh—it didn’t apparently care. Hel worried even enchanted plate would fail against it, and could imagine the bolt searing through any barrier like it wasn’t even there. To hear the Black Knight tell it, the weapon was one that made even the strongest defensive Skills irrelevant. And more than that, it had something worked into its enchantment that made it react to movement in a way she didn’t like one bit. As a Wind Tyrant, she understood the mechanics of that, and she worried it could take down anything this side of an Avatar.  

And she had absolutely no intention of seeing whether Latham could tank a hit from that thing.

“So, now would be the time for anyone to share if they have any more ideas of how we get out of this,”Arebella said.  

The complete and absolute absence of chat wasn’t reassuring.  

“As long as that Suppression Totem is running, I am afraid there is going to be nothing I have to offer,” Ortel said. “It is negating even the most basic of my Skills.”  

“You and me both,” Karolen added.

Hel focused again and tried to push against the restriction. Tried to fight. But all she managed was a short, pathetic pulse of wind that barely even stirred the dust. It wasn’t even as much as she’d managed when the Black Knight had taken their image—probably to send to mock Lowe. She had no idea if the Inspector would notice the clue she’d woven into her hair, but it had been the best she could think to do at short notice.

“Look, it’s going to be okay,” she said. “We all know Lowe. There’s literally nothing in Soar that’s going to stop him coming through those doors.”  

“Huh,” Arebella said.  

“What?”  

“You’re telling the truth. You really believe that,” Arebella said. “Even with my Skills squished down to Level 8, I can see you’re absolutely sincere in that statement.”  

“When it comes to your boyfriend, Bella, there are only two things that are certain. First, he’s going to have been beaten to a pulp, probably killed, at least once since you last saw him.”  

“Probably twice, in all fairness,” Karolen added.

“Okay. Fair comment. And the second thing?”  

“Nothing in the world is going to stop him from swooping in here and saving us all. No bad guy, no god, and certainly no fucking Black Knight is going to be able to keep him away. You’ll see. Any minute now, Jana fucking Lowe is going to stumble through that door with a big dopey grin and make some sort of wisecrack.”  

Arebella looked around at the room in which they were captured. At the reinforced walls, the lack of windows, and the heavy doors bolted from the outside. She looked at the Suppression Totem humming steadily in the corner, leeching them of all their Skills. She looked at the restraints biting into their wrists, and the traps that had been left for anyone seeking to break in. At the careful, methodical planning that had gone into all of this. 

Her worry was that the Black Knight hadn’t just prepared for intruders. He would be welcoming them.  

Lowe would be coming to save them. That much she absolutely believed.  

And it terrified her.

            







	***





                “I have to say,” Mylaf said, adjusting her collar, “I am absolutely thrilled to be coming ‘undercover’ with you, sir. Thrilled. Tonight has been the most fun I’ve had in years!”  

“Yeah, well,” Lowe said, glancing over his shoulder, “it turns out I’ve already got everyone else I care about kidnapped by a serial criminal. It meant I was kind of thin on the ground for spare hands to bring to the party.”  

“Yep. Sure, Absolutely no offence taken, Jana,” Rook said. “I’m pleased to interrupt my very busy day of Threshold Guarding to come to your assistance. You’re very, very welcome.”  

“You know,” Latham rumbled from up ahead, “if we’re all hoping to go the same way as the Mayor, we’re doing a pretty fucking good job of drawing all sorts of attention to ourselves.”  

The four of them moved through the undercity which threaded beneath Soar’s tangle of passageways, scaffolds, and narrow alleys. The air down here stunk—mostly of old rain and alleyway piss—but this evening it was cut through by the acrid sting of burnt wood and scorched stone. The residue of the explosion had torn through City Hall’s top floor.

“And considering the Black Knight is back blowing up important people, how about we all shut the fuck up and keep moving?” Latham finished.

Lowe, for once, was keeping his mouth shut. He’d never been a fan of spending much time in the undercity of Soar.  He found the city above enough of nightmare as it was already. And the world beneath it? That was something else entirely.  

The undercity was Soar’s shadow. A reflection twisted by everything the world above cast aside. What the streets above discarded—bodies, secrets, grudges—the undercity swallowed whole. It was where debts were paid in flesh, where whispers carried farther than screams, and where the city above pressed down, squeezing life into something mean and desperate. 

But there was no denying if you wanted to get somewhere quickly and unseen, travelling via the undercity was the way to achieve it. Still, Lowe was pretty glad they had Latham with them right now.

“Although, I must say, as fun as this excursion is, I do hate the quiet,” Mylaf said “It’s unnatural.”  

“Enjoy it while you can. It won’t last,” Lowe said. “It never does.”  

They turned a corner and nearly ran straight into a Justicar patrol sweeping through the street. Latham threw out an arm to stop them, pressing them back against the damp brickwork of a half-collapsed warehouse. All of the Justicars they’d come across this evening were being arseholes, but there was an edge to them now as they rousted people off the street. 

“Fuck,” Rook said, ducking more than usually into the shadows. “They’re pulling everyone out for this.”  

He wasn’t wrong.  Although, considering someone - no one was saying the Black Knight yet, but that’s what everyone was thinking - had tried to whack the Mayor, it was hardly surprising the various militias in Soar were losing their shit.

From the increasingly frenzied calls for him to fucking answer your Sending Stone, Lowe knew Cuckoo House had hit the streets in full force. He felt bad for not answering, but if he did, he was sure whatever tracking spell Staffen had put on him would trigger again. And he didn’t want that anyone knowing where he was until his plan was in place. He liked Staffen and was about as sure as he could be that she wasn’t nefariously involved in all this but . . . well, the only way two people could keep a secret was if one of them was dead. 

And, perhaps, not even then. 

However, the Soar Security Service weren’t the only ones out and about since someone had taken their shot. The Justicars were out in their gold and black coats crisp despite the late-night drizzle. The Temple Warders were likewise making their presence known in places they normally didn’t deign to walk and even the Dungeon Keepers, the city’s most reclusive and least cooperative enforcers, had stepped into the light.

The Mayor’s office had been hit and Soar did not know what to do with itself.  It had been years—decades even—since Lowe thought Soar had last seen this level of unrest.  

The Mayor’s tenure had been so long that most people had simply stopped questioning it. Come what may, he had been a constant. An institution in and of himself. Something as unmovable as the stones the city had been built upon. And now, suddenly, that status quo had been nearly upended.

The Tower of Law had summoned an emergency session, pulling every available Council member into conclave to decide how the city would move forward. Normally, such sessions would have been a quiet, bureaucratic affair, held behind heavy doors and thick curtains, but there would be no hiding this from the public. If the Mayor died - and no one Lowe had heard from actually knew the current status of the man - the Council needed to have a plan in place.

And, while they deliberated, everyone was watching.  

On the streets, the people gathered in uncertain clumps, eyes flicking toward City Hall, where the smouldering ruins of the Mayor’s office still cast an eerie glow against the skyline. Some whispered of conspiracy. Others of retribution. But all of them understood one thing—if the Mayor didn’t pull through, shit was going to get real.

And, considering this was Soar, who knew what that might mean.

For now, Cuckoo House was locking down the poor quarters of the city, reinforcing checkpoints, and deploying squads to all major intersections. Lowe didn’t envy his colleagues that task. If there was one thing you didn’t want to be doing when civil unrest raised its head, was standing in a thin line between the mob and where they wanted to go. 

The Justicars, on the other hand, seemed to have lucked out and had been given charge of the higher districts, ensuring that whatever power struggle came next, it wouldn’t get anywhere near an expensive post code- which was just how the people in Jewel Town would like it. The Temple Warders were making themselves known in the markets and the industrial quarters, reminding everyone that divine authority still mattered and that the gods were always watching. 

And the Dungeon Keepers? Fuck knows what they were up to, but they were silently watching in a way that was terrifying pretty much everyone.

It felt like there was a storm coming. But, right now, everyone in Soar was holding their breath.

Well, most people.

“Are you absolutely sure we’re allowed to be walking around like this?” Mylaf whispered, ducking between Latham and Rook as they paused, once again, in an alley as a patrol moved by. “Those uniformed gentlemen seem very keen for us to be moving indoors.” She wiped her hands on her coat and adjusted the dozen or so vials hooked onto the bandolier under her cloak. The glass clinked, and they all, instinctively, winced. 

“Yeah, well,” Latham said, checking the street ahead before motioning them forward, “everyone is very keen for me to be at my post at the Temple, but apparently we’re not at home to doing what we’re told this evening.”

They kept moving quickly, slipping from shadow to shadow, their steps unnaturally light thanks to the Legendary Stealth potion coursing through their veins. Thanks to one of Mylaf’s more exotic creations, their bodies were moving faster and quieter than they had any right to, with their every movement sharpened to a razor’s edge. It made even Lowe, who was usually about as subtle as a bar brawl when creeping about, move with something that approached a predatory grace.

Although extremely powerful, the downside of these particular Stealth potions was that their effects really did not last all that long. This was why Lowe had asked if the Drudge would accompany them as even stored in an inventory, they’d burn out well before they could be used. And using them too often would trigger a fairly awful debuff. Thus, she was with them to make sure neither of those disasters happened.

Speaking of which, whe slipped a piece of gingerbread from her  inventory and shoved it into Lowe’s hand. “Eat.”

“Again?”

“Eat it. You’re Overjuicing again. I can tell. Your hands are shaking.”

Lowe shoved the gingerbread into his mouth without argument. The Overjuiced debuff turned all the benefits of the Stealth potion into a liability real fast. If he let it kick in his eyesight would become too sharp, his nerves too frayed and his muscles would react too fast to obey his brain’s orders. Even a man like Lowe with all of his healing ability would very quickly turn into mush.

“You two as well,” Mylaf tossed Rook and Latham their own slices of cake before downing another vial of  Stealth herself. The sensation of power was immediate—like stepping into a stronger, faster version of herself. 

Rook was chewing slowly. “I have to say, I fucking hate this stuff.”

“It tastes wonderful!” Latham said.

“Not if you don’t have functioning tastebuds, I’m afraid. As it is, it’s like having wallpaper paste in my mouth.”

“Still better it’s much better than getting caught sneaking into the Tower of Law,” Mylaf said brightly. “And infinitely preferable to your individual body parts liquifying due to Overjuicing.”

 

“If we’ve all finished moaning, we need to move,” Lowe said. 

The entrance ahead of them to the Tower of Law was , unsurprisingly locked down tight—patrols moving like clockwork around the perimeter. From where they were, they could see Justicars watching the main doors and a bunch of Temple Warders amongst them keeping an eye on the mana signatures of anyone with a dangerous Class trying to slip past.  Considering those two groups absolutely hated each other, there was an unwelcome added frisson in the air.

Interestingly, though, no group appeared to be overly concerned with the lower service doors. 

The trick though, of course, was going to be getting to them.

They waited, listening to the rhythm of the patrols. Footsteps passed, growing fainter. Latham clicked his fingers once. That was the signal to take another potion. And to move.

The first hurdle was a locked grate covering a drain tunnel beneath the outer wall. Nothing flashy, nothing clever of using any sort of mana rune. It was just an old-fashioned, iron-barred obstruction. Lowe pulled out a pair of wire cutters and went to work. “Tell me,” Mylaf said, “should I be concerned that a member of the Security Service is quite so  au fair with breaking and entering?”

“You think this is bad,” Rook said, “you should see him in the canteen dinner queue.”

“I would really love it if everyone could stop it with the ‘Lowe is getting fat’ gags, please,” he said, pulling the grate free for them to slip inside. 

Moving as fast as Stealth allowed them, they moved into the undercroft—old storage tunnels used for maintenance and waste disposal from the Tower of Law above. They moved quickly - obviously - weaving through the tunnels and dodging the occasional guard on maintenance duty. Mylaf kept her potion vials handy and passed them out just before the last one began to wear off. Even down here, Lowe had drilled it into them that all sorts of alarms would trigger should that protection drop off. And this plan absolutely needed them to arrive in the Tower of Law unseen.You might be reading a pirated copy. Look for the official release to support the author.

Before long they reached an iron hatch that, according to the blueprint Latham had scared up, would lead to service stairway to the roof of the building. Rook pressed his ear against it, listening, then turned to whisper ‘two of them’. He motioned to Latham, who nodded, flexed his fingers and positioned himself on the opposite side of the hatch. 

Lowe held up three fingers. Two. One.

The hatch burst open as Latham surged through it. Literally. The others followed through the Latham-shaped hole he punched in the wall. The guards - common-or-garden City Watch - had just enough time to look surprised before he grabbed one and slammed him into the wall. Rook followed through the gap, striking the second guard with a blow to the face which knocked them out cold.

“I have to say,” Mylaf tutted, “I do think it is a little unfair on these poor gentlemen to be pounced on in such a fashion. They were only doing their job after all.”

Lowe dragged them back into the undercroft, stripped them of their security tags, and stuffed them into a storage closet. “If it makes you feel any better for their discomfort,” he said, “we’re all absolutely in execution territory right now.”

Surprisingly, no one seemed to think that made them feel any better.

They continued to climb higher up the Tower of Law. With every step they took, they could feel the tension around the building rising. The attempted assassination might have sent shockwaves through Soar, but that was nothing compared to the frenzy of activity since it had taken place. Guards were tripled, security runes were burning hot, and - they’d heard whispered as they snuck past - the entire Council was in an emergency session in a chamber at the very peak of the Tower, no doubt trying to figure out which of them was the person whose appointment, should the worse happen, would keep the whole damn city from tearing itself apart.

Under the influence of as much Stealth as they could throw down their throats, they moved through corridors, slipping past the increasingly sparse and scattered patrols. 

“Funny,” Rook said, “it’s all a bit like bees, isn’t it?”  

“Like what?” Latham said.

“Bees will die for the hive,” Rook went on. “But only at the entrance. The workers fight at the threshold, throw themselves at anything they think is a threat. But once you're inside? Walk carefully, move slowly, and they let you be. The instinct to attack stops. They don’t know what to do with an intruder who doesn’t act like one.”  

They climbed another flight of steps, passing through a corridor of draped silks and polished marble, walls carved with suitably lawyery reliefs. There were still no alarms about their presence. No hurried steps following them. 

“It’s like the higher we go, the less they notice,” Rook said. “It’s why when reach into a hive with your bare hands to lift out the queen, no one will stop you.”  

“When the fuck did you start keeping bees?” Lowe said, munching down on another piece of the gingerbread.

“It’s very soothing,” Rook said. “You’d be surprised at all sorts of the things I’ve had to pick up recently.”

Then, abruptly, they had reached the door to the roof of the Tower of Law. It had all been much easier than it should have been, Lowe thought. There’d not even been any sentries at the last stairwell. And now they were here, and the final part of his plan was ready to put into action.

Lowe had been up here before. Not like this, of course. Not with his breath held and his pulse a steady drumming beat in his ears, but on days when the city had been nothing more than a teeming sprawl of ants beneath him. He and Arebella had countless stolen moments here over the years, snatching a kiss or two on a roof that looked out over all of Soar, the wind catching at her hair, laughter muffled against his collar.  

By the look of the blitz sticks crushed underfoot, they weren’t the only ones who made use of the place. This place was obviously a smoker’s retreat between duties, somewhere those who worked within the Tower of Law came to step outside of themselves for a moment. To let their thoughts dissolve into the sky.  

The door at the top of these stairs was plain and unmarked. No crest, no lock and no heavy iron bolt to bar their way. It clearly wasn’t meant to keep anyone out. It was just a door to be used only by those who belonged here. By those who never imagined an intruder might reach it.  

Lowe glanced at the rest of his group. None of them spoke.

Beyond the door, the wind would be waiting, the cold air rolling around under a vast open sky. However, most importantly, it would also afford them a view that stretched down into the glass-domed Council Chambers, where a very tense meeting was currently going on.  

Lowe set a hand to the latch and pushed it open. No alarm. The hive had not stirred.

“Remind me again why we think this is  a good idea,” Latham said. 

“Never said it was a good idea,” Lowe said. “I just said that, if I were the Black Knight, having just tried to take out the Mayor, the absolute next place I’d be heading to would be here. The last time he was active, the Council made a resolution to never meet together to avoid giving him a ‘target rich environment.’ I wouldn’t be at all surprised if this is the last time they allow themselves to be in one room again before he is caught. If the Black Knight wants to up the ante - maybe finish off what he started way back when - it is going to have to be now or never. So, we go out there, get ready and when he shows up here we, you know, take care of business.”

They stepped out onto the roof.

The wind howled about them, tearing at their cloaks, dragging at every loose thread like it meant to unmake them. If Lowe didn’t know better, he’d say that Hel was out and about and feeling very annoyed about life. Thinking of his friend made Lowe unaccountably sad, and he pushed that from his mind. 

From this position up high, they were looking down at the glass dome above where the Council were sitting in their gilded chairs, draped in all sorts of self-importance. Lowe didn’t think there were any raised voices—not yet—but the tension in there was clear. Someone had taken a shot at the Mayor and none of them were sure what that meant for them. 

At the very centre of the room, a great table sprawled beneath a mess of parchment. Lowe thought he could make out maps curled at the edges, documents held down by ornate seal-stones and, of course, Sending Stones buzzing repeatedly like dying embers. Each one of those was carrying a message from somewhere in Soar, another piece of bad news laid at their feet. Lowe was getting fed much the same info on his own device: reports of all sorts of unrest and riots.

Not once did any of them look up. Lowe supposed there was no reason for any of them to do so.  

Lowe’s fingers curled against a rail that kept him from approaching too near the edge. He had no love for that place down below. The last time he had stood in their, it had been when they had voted, unanimously, to Classtrate him. To strip him of most of his Skills, and sever him from everything that made him useful to the world.

That was the kind of people they were. And, not for the first time, he wondered if the Black Knight might not have  had the right of it when he did his best to wipe these fuckers out. Wouldn’t Soar just be better off if he just sat back and let things take their natural course over the next bell or so . . .

But then he thought of a small, broken body in a deserted warehouse and, as far as he was concerned, that way of thinking could fuck right off. Any end like that could never justify the means.

Nevertheless, Lowe could still see each and everyone of their faces in his mind. The way they had looked at him. Not with hatred. Not even with cruelty. But with such a weight of disdain. He had been a disappointment, and they had simply voted to throw him and everything he had been away.  And now there they were beneath him, draped in their robes of power, gnawing at their own fear like rats on a ship that was both sinking and on fire.

As a group, they set themselves up on the roof, each hidden in the deep shadows and eyes scanning the surrounding space for any sign of the Black Knight’s incursion.

“And now what?” Mylaf whispered from her position on the extreme left of the Tower’s roof.

“Now?” Lowe said, looking down through the glass dome where his Perception revealed an empty chair, its owner very conspicuously absent from proceedings. “Now you get to be introduced to the little known, but most common aspect of the work of Cuckoo House. We’re going to sit still, probably for a couple of bells,  and wait for the real action to start.”

***

The Black Knight didn’t like leaving anything to chance. He never had.  

That was how lesser men died, after all. Those poor fools never took the time to plan properly. They just acted and trusted to luck, blithely assuming Soar had a sense of fairness. ‘Remember the six Ps,’ the Boss had always said. Proper Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance. The Black Knight had made it this far because he did not trust in anything else other than his own competence.

Certainty was to be found in the little details. The way a guard’s patrol route could be measured to the precise second. The exact weight of a coin pouch so that it secured a man’s loyalty. And, of course, both the silence that fell before a kill and the awful quiet that appeared right after. 

Those two were the key to knowing when to strike and, far more importantly, when to wait.  

So, right now, he was waiting.  

The emergency Council session was dragging on and on deep into the night. From everything he had been able to ascertain, the city outside the walls of the Tower of Law was still in complete shock, its heart stuttering from the sudden, violent attack on the Mayor. Good. That was, after all, the whole point. Of course, he’d never had any expectation that his assault would actually be able to kill the man - from that range, and with the Mayor in his own office, his defensive Skills would have far too extensive for that - but that had not been his aim. The Black Knight knew that, should he seek to get all these important men and women in one room, that attack would be the only way. 

And now here there were. At his complete mercy.  

Although, things had almost gone wrong once he had kicked that particular hornet’s nest. The speed in which the Justicars had locked the Tower of Law down had taken him by surprise. He had expected to have been able to be in position before that had happened but - fortunately - he had prepared for that eventuality and had been able to use his trump card to assist him in slipping inside. And now here he was, hidden from sight, and making little adjustment to his crossbow, all the time being careful that the other hidden watchers on this roof did not notice him.

The Black Knight took his time, adjusting things until he was in the perfect position for this final shot. He rested the lip of his weapon over the edge of the roof so that the weight was supported by the stone. He loved this crossbow. It was an executioner’s tool, created and given to him for a single purpose. Each of his bolts was powered to cut through any and all defensive Skills and protections and the one he had one loaded up for this final, dramatic shot was one which would engulf the entire Chamber below in a colossal, demon-infused fireball. 

All that remained was to wait until the star of this particular show to arrive.

Then, even as he watched, the door to the Council chamber swung open, and the Mayor hobbled in.  

The man moved like someone who’d been hurt badly and didn’t trust any of his wounds to stay closed. Interesting, the Black Knight thought, he’d seemingly hit closer to the mark than he thought! The Mayor’s grip on his cane was white-knuckled, and the muscle at his jaw twitched like he was holding back either pain or rage. Probably both. But that was to nothing compared to the paranoia which rolled off him in waves. The rest of the Council visibly shrank from it, their whispers thinning into silence.  

Everyone within that room was profoundly rattled and, perhaps, for the first time in a long time, the Black Knight was truly pleased.

The Council members had all stood at the Mayor’s arrival, bowing their heads low. The Black Knight almost smiled at them presenting the perfect target. Almost. Then, he shifted his grip on the crossbow and prepared to kill them all.

It was funny, but he hadn’t accepted a contract in over a year. There hadn’t really been any point. Having stolen away the Highberg ransom, he’d been set up for life. But it had never been about the gold, had it. And it hadn’t been about the politics, or the pursuit of power. Or even the settling of personal grudges. He had spent all that time cutting away the dead wood at the summit of Soar, but in the end he had grown to realise that, despite everything he had done to improve things, Soar remained no different. And, with regret, he had come to recognise that the Mayor and the Council were the reason for that. 

Whilst it might seem gauche to be about to bite off the hand that had so well remunerated him for services rendered, the Black Knight was settled on this course of action. The Mayor and the Council must die if Soar was to survive. He had hoped that Arkola would move immediately against the Mayor and the Warden once the Vault was plundered of its booty, but that had not come to pass.

On reflection, perhaps, he should have known better about that. He had, after all, played that particular card once before, hadn’t he? When he had originally delivered that strange statue to the Mayor. His expectation had been that, in short order, Arkola would immediate turn City Hall into an ash heap. But instead, there had been negotiation. Compromise. And the Mayor had continued to be in power.

It just showed, didn’t it, that you couldn’t trust anyone in this city.

A lesson he seemed to have needed to learn again and again.

However, now he was here - looking down on all those important, serious people - he was actually quite glad how everything had worked out. There was nothing quite like being able to bring the game to a conclusion yourself, up close, was there? To pull the curtain down on the whole performance with one big boom.

With all of these greybeards gone, Soar would finally be open to new arrangements. New balances of power would rise and the next pieces would be ready to be moved.  

It was time. 

The Black Knight took a final check of his aim, breathed in, and held it, focusing on the empty chair at the table below. The chair that belonged to Soar’s ruler. The one to which he was moving, painfully, towards. It would be fitting for the Mayor to be the first to die. After which, there would be no shortage of souls meeting their gods. 

The power of the crossbolt thrummed beneath his fingers.  

And he waited.  

Waited for just the right moment.  

Waited for the weight of certainty to settle.  

Because the Black Knight didn’t like leaving anything to chance.  

He never had.

Then, without any warning at all, he felt the cold touch of metal resting against the back of his neck.“

Well fuck me, little man. Who would have guessed it? Like a stopped clock, you’ve actually been right twice today!”

If the first voice was wryly amused, then the second one to speak was cold as ice. 

“Okay Rook, I think it's about time you put the crossbow down.”

            







	***





                “You know what, Jana, I actually don’t think I will.”  

Rook’s hands didn’t so much as twitch on the crossbow, which was quite something considering Latham had a massive broadsword poking at the back of his head. Nevertheless, despite that handicap, the Threshold Guardian’s stance remained solid, and his mana-powered breath was entirely slow and measured. 

There was absolutely no sign that he was feeling any fear. There was no uncertainty in his posture. Even at the end, it seemed that he would be the consummate professional. And, in these sort of circumstances, Lowe didn’t like professionals. . . . 

“Okay, mate. Well, how about I put it another way for you and see if you can get on board with this instruction,” Lowe said. “Either you put the crossbow down right now, or Latham is going to cut your head off.”  

The pressure of Latham’s blade against Rook’s neck increased ever so slightly. Not enough to do real damage. Just enough to absolutely promise it. No blood ran down from the small cut that appeared at the nape of his neck because, of course, as a Threshold Guardian, he didn’t have any of that running through his body, did he?  

“You could do that,” Rook said. “But then you’ll never find where I left the bodies of all your poor friends. I know you, Jana. You’ll go mad with grief, wondering where their mortal remains lie. If I die here, you’ll never get a moment’s peace wondering about their final moments.”  

“Wow! Well, doesn’t that sound shitty?” Lowe said. “‘Never a moment’s peace.’ My word, what an awful outcome that would be for me. What do you think about that, Mylaf?”

“I agree, sir. And, frankly, I’m quite shocked about the whole thing. That does indeed sound like a quite horrible thing to experience. To be honest, sir, it is almost enough to make me not feel quite so bad to have put all that poison into his gingerbread.”

“What?” Rook went to turn, but Latham pressed his sword a touch deeper. A good inch of the blade vanished beneath the skin.

“How about you, Latham? Does that threat never to know about Hel’s ‘final moments’ get your knees knocking?”

“Sort of. But, you know what?” Latham said, “I reckon that sort of creepy ultimatum would sound pretty fucking persuasive for us to let him go. Well, that is if we didn’t already know where he was holding them.”  

Rook’s body didn’t move any further, but Lowe thought there was a new set to his shoulders now. Was that a flicker of doubt? Of uncertainty buried under all those years of hard-earned control.  If there was, he continued to hide it well. “Bullshit,” he said. 

“I’m afraid it’s the true word, mate,” Lowe said. “Well, true acronym, anyway. Oh,” he said as Rook seemed to shiver slightly, “are you starting to feel the poison work on you yet?”  

Rook made to turn again, a flicker of intention in his stance, but Latham pressed down even harder, and this time, a thin line of goo spurted out of the wound to trace its way down his neck.  Was that . . . embalming fluid? 

“Ah! Ah! Ah!” Lowe said, taking a step closer to the Black Knight. “I need to be clear that you should be very careful about making any sort of sudden moves right now. My Templer Warder friend here is experiencing all sorts of vengeful, dare I say, deeply homicidal feelings right now. It might be best for you not to give him any more of an excuse to do you catastrophic damage. Especially as you’ve got a metric fuckton of . . .  sorry, what did you say you’d put in the gingerbread, Mylaf?”

“I made the dough for the loaf Mr Rook has been eating this evening from with Aqua Mortis, sir. Which is, of course, more commonly known as Deathwater. A rather overly dramatic name for a distilled alchemical toxin that binds with necrotic energies, severing the force keeping the undead animated. When ingested, it calcifies necrotic tissue and forces the undead body to, really quite rapidly, collapse into inert matter. Now, I know that Mr Rook is not technically one of the undead, but I do think that my Legendary Skill might have . . . oh, how did you put it, sir? Henched the impact the fuck up.” 

“You snuck Deathwater into me?”  

Lowe’s grin became even wider. “Damn straight. I finally got around to reading up on Threshold Guardians, and it was clear that, without a little something, something to even the odds, even Latham was going to struggle to take you down - especially once you hit Level 50, killing Synchler. Now, though? Well, now I reckon you’re probably just a few minutes away from turning to goo all on your own. Which sounds like a pretty shitty way to go, but, you know what, I’m not feeling all that empathetic towards you right now.”

Rook still didn’t say anything.

“Oh, come on, mate. Surely this is the time for some good old fashioned villain monologuing. Speak now or forever regret it as a puddle of gingerbread vomit. For example, you’re probably dying to know where you slipped up. And I tell you, it’s a doozy. In other circumstances, it would probably really make you laugh. Let me tell you about Hel’s new hairstyle.”  

“What are you talking about, Jana?” Rook said, head starting to swim as the effects of the Deathwater bore down on him. 

“GNROLLG,” Lowe said, drawing out the letters in the air like a schoolteacher leading a slow child through his lessons.  

“What?!” 

“The Grand Necropolitan Rest of Our Lady of the Lingering Glance,” Lowe said watching Rook’s hand on the crossbow carefully. He was fairly sure that his ex-friend hadn't positioned a remote-release bolt this time like he had used to wipe out Drefleck, but he wasn't absolutely certain. And he wasn't really sure how Rook was able to trigger it anyway. That was a sort of uncertainty that ramped up a person's paranoia. Well, no plan was foolproof. “You know, the place where the two of us, after such a long hiatus in our friendship, accidentally bumped into each other once again. Right after the Black Knight apparently came back.” He let that hang in the air for a second. “That’s where you’re keeping them, right? In one of the tombs at your place of work.”  

Silence.  

“I’m going to take your awed, dumbstruck silence as an eloquent ‘fuck! You got me.’” Lowe tapped the side of his head. “Too late to try to mask it now, mate. I see you.” He turned slightly, glancing towards the district of Soar that held the graveyard. “And, as we speak, I’m sure Commander Staffen will be busy breaking them free. You see, that’s the good thing about having a Guardian of the Wall on your side. There’s precious little that woman won’t stomp into dust given half a chance. I’m sure you’ve got all sorts of epic and suitably nasty traps rigged up for when poor little old me goes stumbling through the door. I’m not sure how much cop they’ll be proving against her, though. So sorry about that.”  

Now, that was a lie. A massive, gaping, reality-defying, absolutely unverified lie. Although he’d eventually managed to get a message to Staffen, he had no idea if she’d done anything about it yet. The attempted murder of the Mayor kind of took precedence over pretty much everything else. However, Lowe was putting the house on Rook not being sure of that. And, right now, that was all that mattered.  

Rook’s body remained frozen for three whole seconds. The sound of a round of applause for the Mayor drifted up from the chinless wonders below. Somehow, no-one down there was noticing the drama being enacted above them. Which, once again, didn’t speak especially highly for the effectiveness of the Justicars on full ‘assassin’ watch. If they all got out of this alive, Latham and the rest of those who worked at the Celestial Temple were going to be able to do quite the gloating. Maybe.

More embalming fluid slipped down Rook’s collar, spurting from the wound Latham’s blade was gouging in the back of his neck. Finally, he spoke up.  “You know what, Lowe? I think you’re bluffing.” 

“Am I?”  

“Yes.”  

“I mean, I dunno, mate,” Lowe said. “That would be a hell of a bluff, wouldn’t it? Especially for someone like me who has all sorts of, you know, feelings for other people. Obviously that’s not your thing, but some of the rest of us bother about details like that. It’s the only reason you still have a head, for example.”  

Rook’s lips parted slightly, but no words came.  

Lowe took another step forward. “This is not really going your way, is it? Why don’t you drop the bow and then we can have a chat about old times.” Rook’s grip tightened slightly on the crossbow, which made Lowe sigh.

“Okay, fine. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that I am bluffing. That Staffen isn’t right now, at this very moment, kicking in the doors of that little tomb you’ve got them stashed in. That she isn’t already marching their very pissed-off selves to safety. What’s actually your plan here?”  

Rook laughed at that.

A big, booming laugh that rang around the Council Chamber. 

The sound caused all sorts of people to look up and point towards them. Someone screamed and then the Mayor was being bundled out of the room. Rook raised his arms in the air. “Fine. You win, Jana. Can I turn around?”

“Drop the fucking bow,” Latham said, “and I’ll think about it.”

Rook did so, the crossbow clattering over the balcony edge. 

"And release any 'oh, it can't be me, I was standing right here when it happened' magic fucking bolt' that you might have floating around."

A bolt smashed from nowhere into the ground at Lowe's feet. Sometimes, it was nice to be right. And sometimes, it absolutely sucked.Love this novel? Read it on Royal Road to ensure the author gets credit.

When Rook turned around, Lowe was struck by how much the man he had thought his friend had changed. And he didn’t think that was just the Deathwater and the partial decapitation.

“Oh don’t look so fucking disappointed in me, Jana. It’s pathetic. Is this really so much of a surprise to you?”

“That you are the Black Knight? Yeah. Pretty much.”

“Of course I was the Black fucking Knight, you moron! Did you really think poor Coda had it in him to pull that all off?”

Lowe didn’t know what to say to that. He’d been rehearsing how this conversation was going to go ever since Latham and he had hatched this plan, but he still couldn’t decide what he wanted to say first. “But . . . why?” Well, that seemed to be a solid catch-all way to go.

“Jana, you look like you’re about to cry. Pull yourself together., mate. This is your big moment, don’t spoil it by being all tragic. Why? What a moralistic way of looking at the world. Why? You know what? To begin with, the why was just because it was so fucking exciting! Ah, there’s that disappointed face again. Look, Commander Cenorth himself asked me to do some little ‘off the book’ jobs for him. Can you imagine what a rush that was? Well, actually, I’m sure you can. Because you were his good little Golden Boy, too, weren’t you?”

“Little man, I’m not sure we have time for this right now, there’s a couple of Justicars down there looking pretty pissed . . .”

“Oh, do be quiet, Temple Warder. It doesn’t matter anymore. Nothing matters anymore.” Rook said, and then turned back to face Lowe “Yeah, you know what I’m talking about, don’t you? You got to be Cuckoo House’s White Knight. So many plaudits for Jana Lowe. All of those commendations. Did you know how much the rest of us hated you? It was so obvious you were the favourite. And then there was me. I was the one getting my hands properly dirty for the boss. And where was my thanks?

“There’s a big difference between ‘getting your hands dirty’ and slaughtering people, Rook. Don’t pretend to me that you don’t know there’s a line.”  

“Fuck’s sake! When did you become so sanctimonious, Jana? Did I kill people? Sure. And I got very well paid for it. Very well for it, indeed. ” Rook let out a short, bitter laugh, shaking his head. “You better believe that the Mayor was a very generous sponsor. All he needed Cenorth to do was thin out his competition a little. And I was happy to take my cut in doing that. But I got my fucking comeuppance, didn’t I? Or did you miss the part where Cenorth blew my fucking chest out?”  

Behind them, the door they had exited from shuddered under the impact of heavy, motivated bodies slamming against it. The Justicars were seeking to force their way through. The frame groaned as Latham ran to brace himself against it, his bulk absorbing the subsequent impact. “Wrap it up, little man!”  

Rook swayed again, then dropped to one knee, breathing heavily. “In your heart of hearts, tell me you don’t think I did the right thing, Jana.” His voice was lower now, but it carried across the roof. “We talked about it often enough, didn’t we? How the rich in Soar were getting fatter, hungrier, more powerful, while the rest of us were left choking on their scraps. Tell me you didn’t feel it—just a pulse, just a flicker—every time you found the next body. Another rich twat, brought down a peg.”  

“We don’t take the law into our own hands.”  

“Don’t we?” Rook let out a rasping chuckle. “Ha. Tell that to the shade of Cenorth. You took a whole lot of law into your hands there, didn’t you? I read all about that. What’s good for thee is not for me? To be honest, I should thank you. It was only with him gone that I was able to get back to my work.”  

Lowe’s hands curled into fists. “What happened with Cenorth wasn’t—”  

“Wasn’t what? Vigilante justice? Bloody retribution?” Rook grinned, dark fluid flecking his teeth. “It was the same thing. It’s always the same thing. It’s just a matter of who writes the story afterwards. White Knight or Black Knight. It just depends upon where you sit. And what your own, private score is. Well I don’t have one. And I don’t care.”  

The doorframe cracked, and Latham dug his heels in. He was doing sterling work, but it clearly wouldn’t last.  

Rook tilted his head, looking past Lowe, out over the city. The lights of Soar stretched in every direction, flickering like dying stars. “You want to know what I think, Jana?” Rook’s voice softened, becoming almost wistful. “I think you did feel it. The joy. The rush. You just don’t like what it says about you.”   

“I didn’t enjoy it, Rook,” Lowe said. His friend had always been able to find where the hidden bruises were.

A final impact against the door sent Latham stumbling forward. The appearance of the Justicars to proceedings was just moments away.  

Rook dragged himself to his feet, wiping a smear of bubbling liquid from his mouth with the back of his hand. He was starting to lose this physical composition. Mylaf’s Death Water was doing its worst. The Threshold Guardian turned his gaze back to Lowe and studied him for a long moment. “Perhaps you’re telling the truth. You were always the best of us,” he said, voice almost gentle now. “But you know the thing about being a White Knight, Jana? It might make you feel better about things, but you’re still just another piece on someone else’s board.”  

“Rook—”  

But Rook had already moved. One step, two, onto the edge of the railing.  The wind caught his coat, sent it billowing like a torn flag. He swayed, just a little, and gave a lazy salute, the half-smile still playing at his lips, like all of this was just a joke he’d been waiting to tell.  

“All the defensive Skills in my tomb are tagged to my Core. Once I die, they’ll switch off, and your friends will be able to walk free on their own.” With effort, he breathed in, tasting the night air. “So that’s one good deed for the record, at least. I never meant that child to die, Lowe. Please believe me on that one. That was all the Boss. He knew I’d never stand for anything like that, and you—” a low chuckle, almost fond “—you’d already turned him down as my replacement, hadn’t you? He knew you were never gonna play his game. Neither was I, not on that one. He left the gold in my tomb, you know? As a ‘sorry’. But you know how it goes. You stand still long enough, and someone moves the pieces around you.”  

The wind tugged at his hair, at the edges of his words, fraying them into the dark.  

“I’ve been thinking a lot about what happened in the park. The best I can make sense of it is that it turned out we weren’t Knights at all. Just Pawns to be sacrificed. But when you took Cenorth down, I thought, maybe, I could cause Arkola to finish the job with the Mayor. To wrap it all up nice and neat.” A pause. A wry smile. “Turned out I was wrong. Hey ho.”  

For a second, just a second, it looked like he might say something else. Something final. Something that would help Lowe make sense of it all. But then he just gave a little shrug, an easy thing, like a man stepping off a train at his stop.  

And then he jumped off the edge.

Lowe lunged forward, but it was too late. He caught only air, and then, with no hesitation - just insane instinct - he dived off the Tower after him.  

The wind tore the breath from his lungs as he plummeted. Rook was below him, a dark silhouette against the glow of Soar’s endless sprawl, his coat flaring like the wings of a broken bird. A cuckoo making its last call.  And then their eyes met.  

And then, Lowe wasn’t falling any more. He suddenly became weightless, suspended in a universe that had seemingly been waiting for him all along. But then, of course Arkola had known this moment coming. Maybe not the details, not the when or the how, but certainly the feeling of it. The inevitable pull of a conclusion they had spent too long pretending didn’t have its hands around all of their throats.  

He supposed Rook had known, too.  

The look in his friend’s eyes wasn’t fear at the imminence of death. It wasn’t even surprise. Just complete and total understanding.  

Soar rushed up to meet them.  

And then—  

It can end here, should you so wish.

The voice was not a voice. It had no sound, no shape, nothing for the ear to catch. It was simply there, sliding into Lowe’s mind as effortlessly as breath. Arkola.  

The city below blurred, the glow of lanterns and flickering arc-lights stretching into smears of colour, distended and dreamlike. Even the howl of the wind softened, became something almost intimate. Lowe suspected this had become a very different kind of descent.  

Not so long ago, you were given a gift, Inspector. The Blood of the Phoenix. The chance of return, where none should be given.

Lowe’s fingers spasmed. His coat twisted around him, catching the slow drag of the air.  

But gifts can be refused. Arkola’s voice was patient. Unhurried. As if this had always been a conversation waiting to happen.  You can choose to let go, should you wish.

Lowe’s heart hammered. He could feel the strain in his body. The pull of gravity. The pressure in his skull. The crush of it all exploding in his chest. But any pain was oddly muted, like some afterthought. It was Arkola’s words that interested him, though. This could be it. Lowe could choose not to come back. To not crawl out of yet another grave.  

After all the tumult of the last year. . .  All the pain and tumult and effort. He could choose to accept the silence.  Because it was so tiring, wasn’t it? Getting up. Again and again. Carrying the weight of things that never changed. That never got better. That just turned to shit in different ways. He’d done everything he needed to do since his Classtration, hadn’t he? Recovered his honour. Avenged the death of Highberg’s kid. Finally defeated the Black Knight.

He looked at Rook, who was still smiling up at him. Just a little. A knowing curve of his lips. A flicker of something behind his eyes. That man had never expected to make it out alive. That had been the difference between how they had played this game. Lowe had fought to survive. Rook had known he wouldn’t.  

You were never supposed to exist this long after losing your Class, Arkola’s voice buried into him. Should you choose to step away, this would be just a return to the nature of things. The balance would be restored by this fall. Should you so wish.

 

Lowe closed his eyes. And in the dark, he thought about the possibility of letting go. Of there being no more waking up with blood on his hands. No more dragging himself through another day in a city that ate its own. No more wondering if anything he did really mattered. Just . . . The end.  

No more pain.

The wind pulled at him again. He could feel the weight of his body. The approach of terminal velocity and the inevitable, crushing end. It would be so easy to accept it. Rook had already let go, hadn’t he? Why shouldn’t he? They could leave this game together. Yes, he’d like that.

Lowe opened his eyes. Decision made.  

But then he saw that Rook was still watching him. And in his gaze, Lowe thought he recognised something unexpected. Not resignation. Not triumph. More something like . . . disappointment. And that made him angry. Something old and defiant inside him roared to life. He was still here. And if he was still here, then it wasn’t over.  He wasn’t ready to give up. Not yet.  

You hesitate to leave this life. Why?

“Because ‘fuck you,’ that’s why. You and the whole pack of them.”

A blur of stone and metal approached, shifting light and waiting dark.  Lowe met Rook’s gaze and saw something flicker there. Understanding? Maybe. Or something like it.  

“See you soon, mate,” he said.    

Rook hit first. And then Lowe.  

Then, the world went white.

                The statue stood on its plinth, staring back at Lowe with sightless eyes.

Thinking about it in the cold light of day, Lowe recognised it had taken him far too long to get to this position. There had been too many unnecessary detours down blind alleys. And, once more, far too many were left dead in his wake. Mind you, he struggled to feel too much sympathy for those who had passed since he had become involved in the case. 

The Shimmerskins. The Warden. Rook. 

All of them had more than enough blood on their hands to have deserved their fate. And twice over. 

Still, he had got there in the end. The Highberg case was closed. The Black Knight was slain. And he should have been feeling some degree of peace.

The statue was a heavy little thing. Dark with age. Squat and ugly. A cuckoo, perched as if mid-call.  It had been in the tomb where his friends had been sealed up, hidden beneath a pile of rags. It didn’t looked like much. There was no precious metal anywhere around it. No sparking jewels. It was just a fairly nondescript statue carved in stone. 

Turning away from the bird, Lowe leaned against the balcony of his apartment and took in the view. 

Soar stretched before him, sprawled like a wounded beast under the last light of day. High above, another storm was rolling in, which was pretty unsurprising considering how pissed Hel had been once they’d managed to free her. It wasn’t directly overhead, not yet, but Lowe could already feel its anger. The way the air pressed against his skin and the streets themselves seemed to hold their breath against the coming rain. 

When the lightning came, it was going to be epic.

He knew Soar had always been a bad place. Always would be. It was a city that didn’t just bring its citizens to their knees, it hollowed them out. It filled up their soft places with something rotten, and then turned them loose again with their own knives at their throats. 

He had spent years walking its streets, most of the time thinking he was different. Thinking he was clean.  

Well, Rook had set him straight on that, hadn’t he? White Knight and Black Knight. Both little more than pieces on the board.  

Behind him, he heard boots scuff against the floor Latham. He didn’t need to turn around. He’d got used to the sound of the man having his back.

“You okay, little man?”  

Lowe didn’t answer, but he turned to face his friend. The statue on the table in the living room stared back at him. He thought about going in there and picking it up, then returning to hurl it over the edge. Getting to watch it shatter into nothing against the cobbles below. Just like Rook.

“Funny it all started with that, isn’t it?” Lowe said.  

Latham picked the bird up, studied it, then put it back. “Not funny ‘ha ha’ but sure, you could say that. For my money, though, I think it all started the moment your friend made his choice to play Cenorth’s game. Or maybe it started long before that. And maybe this was just the way it had always been meant to play out in this city.”

That made sense to Lowe. Soar didn’t let men walk away clean. Not the good ones, not the bad ones, and sure as hell not the ones in between.

“What’s next for you?” Latham said.  

“Next?”  

“Yeah, little man. Next. I expect the Mayor’s feeling all sorts of grateful right now. What with you foiling an attempt to assassinate the whole Council, keeping Soar from tearing itself apart and taking down the Black Knight into the bargain. A careful negotiator might even be able to get his Class back.”

“Yeah, he offered something like that.”Ensure your favorite authors get the support they deserve. Read this novel on Royal Road.

“Figured as much. And what did you say?”

“I told him to go fuck himself.”

Latham smiled at that. “Good for you, little man. Good for you.”

“Who needs a Class when you’ve got all sorts of pure Progress Points kicking around, am I right?”

“As much as it hurts me to say it, once again, you’re not wrong.”

Lowe nodded and looked back out at the vista of the city. Despite everything that had happened over the last few days, Soar kept itself going with serenity. Its gears kept turning. Its streets filled up with more names. More faces. More people looking to carve out their own little piece of existence before someone else took it from them.  

The gods of Soar would keep sitting - fat and happy - above them all. Their hands never truly touching the messes their meddling made. And the Mayor, the eternal fucking Mayor, would smooth it all over, promising where he could and threatening where he couldn’t. And the Council would turn a blind eye

But Lowe? Well, Lowe would keep his own counsel. He looked over at Latham. “How about you? You doing okay?”  

“Sure.”  

Lowe nodded. There was probably loads more to say. He doubted they would ever say it.

For a long moment, neither of them spoke, then Latham started back toward the front door. “Anyway, I was just checking in. Hel and I are going to run that Heroic Dungeon again. Do your best not to get yourself killed again today, little man. One of these time, it’s going to stick.”  

Lowe waved him away.  

The statue remained, motionless. Watching. Waiting.  

He could still hear Rook’s voice. You got to be the White Knight. I was the one getting my hands dirty.

It wasn’t that simple. It never had been. Rook had known exactly what he was doing, right up to the end. He had made his choices - including setting up Coda as a patsy to take the fall - just like Lowe had. And yet . . . 

Lowe picked up the statue. It was heavier than it looked, solid in his hands, and with the kind of weight that suggested permanence. Though, of course, nothing in Soar was ever truly permanent. He turned it over, running his fingers along the base, feeling the cold, worn stone against his palm. Someone, long ago, had carved three words into the underside. The letters were uneven. Hurried. As if whoever had put them there had known they wouldn’t have much time.  

Mercy is Spent.

Lowe laughed at that. It figured.  

Rook had always liked to say that nothing really changed in Soar. People fought, schemed, killed, and tried to hold on to whatever scrap of meaning they could find in life. They built things - empires, reputations, debts - and spent their days pretending it all mattered. But in the end? Well, everything returned to the dirt.  

Soar swallowed people whole. It didn’t need war, or plague, or famine to do it. It just kept moving onwards and if you weren’t fast enough, you got ground into dust. ‘It wasn’t personal,’ Drefleck had said, and Lowe that that was the best way of looking at things. Soar was rarely wantonly cruel. It was just the way things were.  

If there was a motto for life in Soar, Mercy is Spent probably was it, wasn’t it?  

Lowe turned the statue over once more, feeling the weight of it in his hands. Ancient stone. Old gods. Older debts.  

Grackle Nuroon had asked for the statue as the price for his help over the memory in the Vault. Gods and their games. Lowe was minded to give it to him. Let Nuroon and Arkola make each other’s lives a misery over its ownership. That seemed like justice, in a way. Maybe.

He set the statue back down and dusted his hands off.

With a boom, the storm above moved closer, rolling in thick over the city. He could feel it pressing down, heavy with unspent mana that made his skin prickle and the hairs on his arms stand up.  

The mana light in the room flickered once, guttered, and then went out. The room fell into shadow, not quite darkness but a light that knew how to pretend.  

A soft knock came from the front door.  Lowe turned, and there she was.  

Arabella stood in the doorway, watching him with that look of hers, the one that always seemed to see more than it should. She was damp from the rain, her coat dark at the shoulders where the storm had already found her.  

For a moment, neither of them spoke.  

Then she smiled. Not a big thing. Not even a full one. Just the faintest curve at the edges of her mouth.  

Lowe smiled back.  

He walked toward her, the weight of the night settling somewhere deep in his bones, but not pressing down as much as it had before.  

The storm would come. It always did.  

But for now?  

For now, he had someone waiting for him.  

And that would do.

He was a whisper in the dark, but now he's noise in bright daylight.Royal Road is the home of this novel. Visit there to read the original and support the author.

Elijah had made a lucrative career of slipping secrets out from behind locked doors. A professional problem solver who never met a job he couldn't ghost once the work in the shadows was complete.

But now, somebody else has decided it was Elijah's turn to disappear. Permanently.

Freshly murdered and rudely awakened by a game-like System, Elijah quickly realises he's traded all his finesse for brute force. His hard-earned skills? Erased. Class choices? Blocked. Instead, he's been saddled with a rather unsubtle new role: Aggro Tank.

Big sword. Flashy armour. Painfully obvious targets.

Worse, something hungry is pushing its way through the thinning veil between our two worlds, and Elijah's forced career change makes him its most likely meal. If he can't quickly adapt to his new role—and unravel the conspiracy behind his assassination—both worlds will end up in flames.

Sometimes, surviving death is the easy part.
